      "message": "Hi Cunyin,\n\nI\u0027m not sure we should have this level of detail in the CHANGELOG - the CHANGELOG typically focused on just the new or changed features and not on implementation specifics.  I think a good comment with a lot of these details could go in the code though.  I think here you can just say something like:\n\nSPDK now supports hotplug for vfio-attached devices.\n\n-Jim",

      "message": "Agreed, this is good information, but CHANGELOG.md is meant to be user-visible changes, so we should go with something more like Jim\u0027s suggestion.  I think most of the detail you provided here was already in previous commit messages, so we shouldn\u0027t need to mention it again as long as VFIO-based hotplug works now.",
