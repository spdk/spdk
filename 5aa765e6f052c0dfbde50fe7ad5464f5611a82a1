      "message": "We should consider changing _nvme_pcie_hotplug_monitor to now use ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb instead of probe-\u003eremove_cb.\n\nI think your patch is correct, but it leads to an odd API consideration where use could specify a remove_cb when the ctrlr was originally probed, but a different remove_cb could be specified later when doing a probe to find hot-removed PCIe devices.  It\u0027s not clear in the API which would be used.  I think we should use this ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb in all cases, rather than probe-\u003eremove_cb for PCIe and ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb for fabrics controllers.",
