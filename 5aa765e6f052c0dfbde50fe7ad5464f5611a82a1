      "message": "We should consider changing _nvme_pcie_hotplug_monitor to now use ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb instead of probe-\u003eremove_cb.\n\nI think your patch is correct, but it leads to an odd API consideration where use could specify a remove_cb when the ctrlr was originally probed, but a different remove_cb could be specified later when doing a probe to find hot-removed PCIe devices.  It\u0027s not clear in the API which would be used.  I think we should use this ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb in all cases, rather than probe-\u003eremove_cb for PCIe and ctrlr-\u003eremove_cb for fabrics controllers.",

      "message": "Yeah, I definitely agree with this. The hard part (from my perspective) is that the user facing APIs for hotplug all require passing in a probe_ctx which includes a remove_cb. I was thinking that in order to clear up that confusion, we would need to update that whole API chain with a new wrapper struct that doesn\u0027t contain a remove_cb. I can do that before this patch if you\u0027d like, or if you feel that there is a simpler way - maybe just documenting the function calls to indicate that the remove_cb the user passes in for hotplug will be unused - I\u0027m good to do that too. I just wasn\u0027t sure about the best path.",
