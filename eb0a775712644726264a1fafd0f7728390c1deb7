      "message": "what if we put cdw0 here instead?  and remove the comment just above (line 559)\n\nI think we can still have sct and sc be valid, even if the bdev_io status is STATUS_SUCCESS.  They would both just equal 0.\n\nI just think your patch shows that we really should have considered cdw0 up front when designing this - it\u0027s just as important as sct and sc.  I think it\u0027s more clear if cdw0 is here.  (I know it\u0027s a bit awkward that it\u0027s part of a union named \"error\" but we could fix that later.)",
