This is wrong, we should only bail out when there\u0027s a send failure (the return value is negative), fix that.",

However, I would like to use my own commit message and would accept some of your ideas. \n\nHowever I would not like to use all your suggested commit message, which does not make sense to me for the open source development. Thanks for the understanding.",
