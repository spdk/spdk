You can\u0027t quickly traverse the tree with this data structure - you have to do a linear lookup in the top level snapshots list each time you move around a level.\n\nI think this is fine for the questions we currently need to ask (i.e. does this snapshot have any clones), but it\u0027s something to keep in mind for later.",
