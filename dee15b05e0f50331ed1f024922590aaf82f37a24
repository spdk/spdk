      "message": "The EINVAL code returned from nvmf_rdma_fill_buffers doesn\u0027t mean that the sgl length exceeded the max I/O size (which is the case in the multi-sgl version of that function), it means that one of the buffers in the shared buffer list has been split over multiple NIC memory regions. As far as I am aware, that error can only be hit when using versions of DPDK older than 19.05 with modern SPDK.\n\nI don\u0027t think that returning -1 is the right thing to do in response to that error, because it will cause the request to fail when there is nothing wrong with that specific request. I think that you should leave the return value the same between those two cases.",
