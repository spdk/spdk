      "message": "I don\u0027t think this comment is clear.  It may be confusing what this comment has to do with arbitration burst \u003c 2.\n\nMaybe it would be better to have the user specify the arbitration burst value explicitly?  I mean, explain that this field means 2^value.  And that valid values are 0-6, and also 7 which means unlimited.\n\nThis avoids case where user specifies invalid values like 43.  This patch would round that down to 32, but really it would be better to make it an error in that case.",
