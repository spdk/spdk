      "message": "I think we\u0027re going to need to add spdk_bs_batch_write_zeroes instead of mapping spdk_bs_batch_unmap to the write_zeroes function call.\n\nThe blobstore.c code will need to explicitly call the spdk_bs_batch_write_zeroes function when it wants to write zeroes.  We will have a future case where we allow a user to unmap (not write zeroes to) a portion of a blob.  So we should plan for that now and have support for both unmap *and* write zeroes.",
