      "message": "I believe NQN is supposed to be case sensitive (we use strcasecmp() on NQNs elsewhere, but I think this is wrong - nothing in the spec says that it is case insensitive).\n\nAlso, the current use of strn*cmp() is not quite correct, since it matches prefixes if subnqn is longer than SPDK_NVMF_DISCOVERY_NQN (e.g. strncmp(\"abcdef\", \"abc\", 3) \u003d\u003d 0).  You can pass sizeof(discovery_trid-\u003esubnqn) if you want to use strncmp(); alternatively, discovery_trid-\u003esubnqn is required to be null terminated anyway, so you can just use strcmp().",
