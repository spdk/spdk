      "message": "I was playing around with some of the other JSON config tests and I feel like too much of the test code is buried in json_config/common.sh. By that, I mean there are functions like \u0027create_nvmf_subsystem_config\u0027 that will only be used in the nvmf JSON test, so why put them off in a common library? That makes the test more difficult to follow because you have to jump between files. Something to consider.",
