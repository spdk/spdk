      "message": "How are these events different than the ones provided by rdma_get_cm_event, which we call periodically in spdk_nvmf_rdma_accept()? There does appear to be more events available through this mechanism at first glance, but other than that I assume rdma_get_cm_event is actually built on top of this mechanism.\n\nI also think the right place to poll these events is in spdk_nvmf_rdma_accept(). When connections come in, we don\u0027t know if they are admin or I/O queues until they\u0027ve been placed into a poll group. So admin queues are running on the same threads as the I/O queues and we have to avoid performing expensive operations there as much as possible. The spdk_nvmf_rdma_accept() path is called by the application periodically to accept new connections and can be done from an arbitrary thread that doesn\u0027t otherwise handle connections.",
