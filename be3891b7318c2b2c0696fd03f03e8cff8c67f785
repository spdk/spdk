      "message": "I think we need to make a small change to how this plugin operations. When we initialize the io_u, we should capture the fio_qpair into the spdk_fio_request structure. Then, we only need to look it up here, during initialization, and we can quickly get to the fio_qpair elsewhere.\n\nIn order to make this change, though, we need to verify that any given io_u is only used for one file throughout its lifetime. I bet this is true, but can you search the fio code to see if io_u-\u003efile is ever updated after initialization?",
