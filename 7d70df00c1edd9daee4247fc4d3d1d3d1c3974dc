      "message": "Thinking about this some more - this breaks the NVMe driver API.  Specifically, anyone using the raw APIs (spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_io_raw, spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_admin_raw, etc.) will now be broken and require modifications when upgrading to SPDK v20.01.\n\nCould we instead change this to:\n\nunion {\n  uint32_t cdw10;\n  union spdk_nvme_cmd_cdw10 cdw10_bits;\n};\n\nI think this should work fine.  There are some compiler warnings sometimes for unnamed unions - we will need to take a look at that.",
