Persistent reservation state is stored in a JSON file on the local filesystem between target restart. To support this, an optional parameter to the RPC method `nvmf_subsystem_add_ns` called `--ptpl_file` was added. This allows the user to specify which file to store the persistent reservation state in. Note that this is done per namespace.",
