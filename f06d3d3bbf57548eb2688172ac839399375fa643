Meaning that for each limit type, we call a function pointer to see if this I/O should be submitted, or if we should exit the loop.\n\nThis should be a preparatory patch, before this one that adds read/write support.  For IOPs and bandwidth, it can jus\n\nIt will make the final code much easier to understand.  This function just calls each of the function pointers - if any of them return false, then the I/O does not get submitted.  This function (in the read/write patch) would have no code related to read or write - all understanding of read v. write would be in the functions called by the function pointers.",
