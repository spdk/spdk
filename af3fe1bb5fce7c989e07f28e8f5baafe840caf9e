I think that spdk_jsonrpc_client_request should contain all fields from spdk_jsonrpc_client_response and connection should maintain linked list of these requests (if ID is provided). This way user will be able to issue more than one request at a time.",

But my ending conclusion is that a brief sync-mode should be enough for most of the cases as a beginning.\nSet of requests or async-mode ability can be treated as better-to-have. they can be implemented like you said if requirements appeared.",
