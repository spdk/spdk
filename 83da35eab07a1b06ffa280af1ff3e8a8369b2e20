      "message": "I think this would be clearer if you made hdr a pointer, and then named the non-pointer version \"hdr_mem\" or something. All the code should access the header via the pointer. That way the pointer could either be pointing at hdr_mem or at some other data buffer and all code throughout both transports would just work without any special cases.",
