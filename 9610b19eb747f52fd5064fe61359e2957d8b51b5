      "message": "I think there should be a comment here then.  Otherwise reader has to figure out that gen_config returns and then pre_test_case function is called.  pre_test_case calls run_vhost (from test/hoplug/common.sh) which executes test/vhost/common/run_vhost.sh.  Then run_vhost.sh calls spdk_vhost_run function which generates the nvme portion of the configuration file.\n\nDoes not have to be a long comment but I think something is needed otherwise to help avoid confusion how this works.",
