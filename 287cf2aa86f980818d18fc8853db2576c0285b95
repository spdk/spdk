So we should either hide this argument from the user and still have distinct construct_nvme_bdev / construct_ftl_bdev (which I\u0027d prefer, since the code duplication would be pretty low and I feel it\u0027d more user friendly this way) or get rid of construct_ftl_bdev and add its arguments (range, mode, etc.) here.",
