      "message": "But it would be safer from a typing perspective to do things like:\n\nstruct ftl_md_io *md_io;\n\nmd_io-\u003eio.flags \u0026\u003d ~(SOME_FLAG | SOME_FLAG2);\n\ninstead of\n\nftl_io_clear_flags(md_io, SOME_FLAG | SOME_FLAG2);\n\nThis would be less prone to errors - things like requiring that the base ftl_io structure is the first member in the derived struct.  It also looks like maybe removing the macros makes the code smaller too (from a number of characters perspective), and would be one less layer of indirection for code readers.",
