      "message": "* I think you could probably submit the nvmf specification header as a separate patch from this one. \n\n* This file can probably just be named \u0027nvmf_fc.h\u0027 - it\u0027s internal just due to where the file is in the directory structure. The only reason we have \u0027nvmf_internal.h\u0027 is because there is a public header already named \u0027nvmf.h\u0027 that conflicts in #include statements.\n\n* It\u0027s hard to do a meaningful review the code in this file because it contains no associated definitions.",
