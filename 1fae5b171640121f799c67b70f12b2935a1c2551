      "message": "Oh - now I see that next patch will modify bdev_qos_io_to_limit() so that we only do qos processing for the start phase.\n\nThat alleviates my concern - but I think in that case we should remove the zcopy.start check below.  We should also move the bdev_qos_io_to_limit() changes to this patch.",
