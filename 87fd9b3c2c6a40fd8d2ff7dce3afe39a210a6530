      "message": "This should be indented with tabs to match the other lines.  It also needs to start with SPDK_ like all other public API names.  Maybe something like SPDK_ENV_MAX_PCI_WHITELIST would be good.\n\nAdditionally, is 16 good enough? This seems fairly limiting, and changing this would break ABI later on, so we should probably pick a larger value, or better yet, make the whitelist point to a dynamically allocated array instead.",
