      "message": "I am a little concerned that rebuilding SPDK in the guest will take too long; it looks like the setup_vm timing section is about 2 minutes currently.\n\nIf we can ensure that the guest and host are running roughly the same Linux distro/version, we should be able to copy in the fio and fio_plugin binaries from the host build rather than rebuilding them inside the VM, which should be much quicker.",

      "message": "Agreed. However, the virtio tests (fedora-07) complete in \u003c7 mins, so they don\u0027t increase the overall TP test time.\nCould we merge this patch as it is and optimize it later?",
