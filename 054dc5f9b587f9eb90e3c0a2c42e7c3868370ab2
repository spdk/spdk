The order of these checks is consistent with the allocation right now, but what if the order of the allocations changes in the future? We don\u0027t want to accidentally introduce memory leaks.",

      "message": "hi Seth, thanks for your explanation. It\u0027s my fault to give this assumption.\nwhen I reviewed the code about nvme_rdma_alloc_rsps and nvme_rdma_alloc_reqs. The similar functions which use different methods, it\u0027s looks a little strange to me. \n\nI just want to keep consistency of these codes.",
