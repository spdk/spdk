      "message": "I couple of things here:\n\n1) since we\u0027re duplicating this TAILQ_FOREACH, should we put this into a helper function?  it should get inlined (and if not, this is for large I/O so extra CPU cycles probably don\u0027t matter)\n\n2) I think this might be simpler to understand:\n\nTAILQ_FOREACH() {\n  if (tcp_req-\u003ereq.cmd-\u003envme_cmd.cid !\u003d h2c_data-\u003ecccid) {\n    continue;\n  }\n  if (tcp_req-\u003ettag \u003d\u003d h2c_data-\u003ettag) {\n    break;\n  } else {\n    ttag_offset_error \u003d true;\n  }\n}",
