I\u0027d like to try to modify the test instead.\n\nCould we do something like this in the unit test:\n\nvolatile uint64_t *length_flushed;\n\n/* length_flushed is modified by a different thread in this unit\n *. test.  So we need to dereference it as a volatile to ensure\n *. the value is always re-read.\n */\nlength_flushed \u003d \u0026file-\u003elength_flushed;\nwhile (*length_flushed !\u003d buf-\u003elength) {}\n\n-Jim",
