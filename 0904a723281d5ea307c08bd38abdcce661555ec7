      "message": "A interesting thing here is, DPS is configured by user, DPC means the controller can support such feature, that\u0027s means DPS should be configured via NVM format command.  Since the block device is already formatted to TYPE1 or TYPE2, so I raised the question here for a open discussion first.",

      "message": "DPC is the capability of the device, while DPS is the current setting. I think what Shuhei is doing here is looking at the current setting of the underlying bdev, and then saying that value is both the current setting and the only supported mode (even if the actual device may support additional modes). I think this is the right approach here.",
