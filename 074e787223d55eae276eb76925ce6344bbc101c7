      "message": "I\u0027m not sure, but this might be still required. There could be still some I/O channels opened for the gpt or lvol scans. Since there won\u0027t be any I/O on this thread (like there is in other SPDK apps) those io_channels and their corresponding io queues will be simply wasted. The real I/O threads might expect them to be available.\n\nWe\u0027ve been noticing this a while ago with the Virtio driver, for which the max number of queues can be specified in config file. Fio_plugin couldn\u0027t do any I/O to a device with just 1 queue available, as at the time of init the queue was still occupied by this management thread.\n\nThe code changed since then, but I believe this is still relevant. This needs to be checked, but please don\u0027t touch it in this patch until we\u0027re sure.",
