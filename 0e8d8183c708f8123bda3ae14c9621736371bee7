FOr example by calling just: test/vhost/spdk_vhost.sh -i ?\n\nThen RUN_NIGHTLY is undefined and you will have if [ -eq 0] condition which will produce a \"unary operator expected\" error and  go to \"else\" branch and run nightly test instead (take a look at failed Jenkins builds in this commit - they run nightly test instead of per-patch version).\n\nI suggest one of these solutions:\na) change to: if RUN_NIGHTLY -eq 1 and run nightly only when RUN_NIGHTLY exists and it\u0027s set to 1.\nb) change [] to [[ ]] brackets",
