      "message": "This is a good catch.  But it makes me think of a couple of things:\n\n1) Instead of bdev-\u003eneeds_aligned_buffer, I think should change it to \"required_alignment\".  0 means no alignment is necessary (the default) - AIO can set it to 512 or 4096.\n2) Did we ever talk about having the bdev layer do the double buffering automatically?  For example, instead if we implement #1, then bdev layer can do these checks for alignment, etc.\n\nI\u0027m also tempted to have the bdev layer just fail any I/O that needs double-buffering but exceeds the max I/O size - at least for now.",
