      "message": "just an idea - but what if instead we made vmd_hotplug_monitor part of the public API?\n\nthen the caller can decide if and when they want to poll for hotplug events, it also allows someone to use this hotplug functionality who isn\u0027t using the SPDK threading library\n\nI guess then that begs the question whether we need the previous patch at all.  We\u0027d also need to decide with test applications need to do hotplug monitoring.",

      "message": "Yeah, your proposal makes more sense. And you\u0027re right, we don\u0027t need previous patch now.\n\nAs for the test apps, I don\u0027t think any of those in examples/vmd need to be monitoring for hotplugs - they\u0027re simple apps that do one thing (listing devices, setting LEDs) and terminate immediately. I was using spdk_tgt to test the hotplugs and it uses event framework, so there\u0027s no need to change anything there.",
