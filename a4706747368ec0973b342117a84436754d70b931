      "message": "Yeah - seems like that is missing.\n\nBut I think we should just do a single bdev_register event.  I don\u0027t think we need separate ones.  A client who gets this event will end up calling the same RPC (get_bdev) for either case.\n\nLooking at spdk_bdev_register and spdk_vbdev_register - they are implemented completely differently although they do the exact same thing!  But obviously we can clean that up separately.  It\u0027s probably a side effect from removing use of the base_bdevs and base_bdev_count parameters.  I think we talked about deprecating spdk_vbdev_register completely too.",
