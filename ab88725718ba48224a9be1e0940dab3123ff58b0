      "message": "Should these also be uint64_t?\n\nlba_per_cluster should never overflow.  But it seems like lba_count could.  In fact I\u0027m trying to figure out why it didn\u0027t on your system with the 4GB SSD.\n\nOh wait - this is the problem on the submitter\u0027s issue I\u0027ll bet!  lba_count overflows from additions in line 687, so instead of length X we get length (X - clusters in 2GB) at line 708.\n\nIf we get the submitters blobcli -D data, it should confirm it.  Is your SSD formatted to 4KB sectors by chance?",
