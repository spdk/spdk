      "message": "I think this library would be useful in more contexts than just as a bdev module if instead of spawning a thread to poll these, it simply exposed a function that polled them one time and returned. That gives users control over when these events are processed.\n\nIn the bdev module that uses this library, you can start a poller that runs every 100us and calls that new function. That\u0027s equivalent to the behavior you have here.",
