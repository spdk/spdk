My thinking is that it\u0027s not a ton of stuff and if you\u0027re firing up vagrant for the intended purpose you\u0027d probably rather hit pg-down a few times as opposed to running into a problem and having no clue whether the output you are seeing is expected or not. This may get outdatedbut I think it still serves the purpose of what a good \"vagrant up\" and hello_world execution should look like",
