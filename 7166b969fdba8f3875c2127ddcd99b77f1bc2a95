      "message": "Instead of hardcoding all of this to one millisecond, could it potentially be variable?\n\nWhat I mean is, instead of \"per_ms\" and \"this_ms\", it is \"per_timeslice\" and \"this_timeslice\".  Then if we find a use case where we want to increase or decrease the time slice, the variable names do not need to be modified.\n\nFor example, maybe we decide that 0.5ms is a better number than 1ms when we start benchmarking.\n\nThen we just need a separate field - maybe timeslice_in_us (number of microseconds per time slice).",
