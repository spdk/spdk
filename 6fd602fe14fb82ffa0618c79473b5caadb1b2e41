      "message": "Shuhei, since legacy mem only applies to your custom use case, could we possibly provide --legacy-mem through this env_context? It\u0027s a string to be appended directly into DPDK command line options and was introduced for cases just like this.\n\nThere\u0027s a separate patch to expose the same env_context in struct spdk_app_opts: https://review.gerrithub.io/c/spdk/spdk/+/443649\n\nIn env_dpdk we would need to disable --match-allocations when the user has provided --legacy-mem, but that\u0027s perfectly doable.\n\nWould that work for you?",
