      "message": "The first part of this ERRLOG is incorrect - but this was also incorrect in the original code. I think the (target-\u003eio_size_blocks \u003d\u003d 0) part can just be removed, or changed to (g_io_size \u003d\u003d 0).  But probably g_io_size \u003d\u003d 0 check should be up front when args are originally parsed.\n\nPlease don\u0027t change this patch - it is fine.  We can make these other changes later.",
