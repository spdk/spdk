      "message": "You should not open the base bdev for each partition.  You should only call spdk_bdev_open() for cases when GPT needs to initiate the I/O operation (i.e. read the partition table).\n\nWe use open/close to ensure only one user can have write access at a time to any given bdev, and also to ensure that if user has a partition open with write access, that someone cannot also open the base device with write access too.\n\n(Note: I need to improve the documentation to make this more clear.)",

If we try to start the nbd process, and it fails for some reason, this script will not cause a test error - it will just skip the GPT tests.",
