I\u0027m pretty sure there are other RPCs that aren\u0027t in jsonrpc.md (not saying that\u0027s a good thing - it\u0027s just a fact).  Putting them here is just going to raise more confusion I think.\n\nI\u0027m just thinking that the vast majority of people reading this file are normal spdk_tgt/nvmf_tgt users, and seeing the documentation here, but no support in rpc.py, will be confusing.",
