      "message": "spdk_nvmf_ctrlr_connect does, in some cases, send a message to a different thread. So in those cases we have to call poll_threads() to process the messages or ASAN reports a memory leak. In this particular case, it does not send an event today. But in order to make the unit tests implementation agnostic I chose to poll after each spdk_nvmf_ctrlr_connect call.",
