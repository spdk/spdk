      "message": "Can we move this stuff into the start function too?  it means lines 1320-1325 would need to move until after -\u003estart() was called.\n\nI feel like there\u0027s more refactoring we can do here.  Is it ever valid to call this function if raid_bdev-\u003estate is not CONFIGURING?  If not, then maybe we should have an assert(raid_bdev-\u003estate \u003d\u003d CONFIGURING) and assert(raid_bdev-\u003enum_base_bdevs_discovered \u003d\u003d raid_bdev-\u003enum_base_bdevs) at the beginning of this function, Then you can simplify this function a bit in a patch before this one, which should make some of this rearranging easier.",
