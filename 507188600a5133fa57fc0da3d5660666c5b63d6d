      "message": "similar to comment on identify - I think we can break this into two functions in one patch, then have this patch change the completion callback routine\n\nThis is such a major feature to be added to SPDK NVMe driver, and changes a lot of the core functionality - I just want to make sure we break these patches up as much as possible so we can review them easier.\n\nThanks!",
