      "message": "Jim suggested this proposal, which I think it\u0027s OK for now, because vhost and muser target are both \"target\".  For long term, I think we need a library \"emulated_nvme\", we can build a \"muser target\" application which can support NVMe/Virtio-BLK/Virtio-SCSI PCI devices, and NVMf can also use this \"emulatd_nvme\" library.",
