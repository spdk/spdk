#   is Listen <type> <address> where type can be RDMA, TCP or FC.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Between 0 and 255 Namespace directives are allowed. These define the

#   The user must specify MaxNamespaces to allow for adding namespaces
#   during active connection. By default it is 0
#   The user must specify a bdev name for each namespace, and may optionally
