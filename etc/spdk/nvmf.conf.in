# NVMf Target Configuration File
#
# Please write all parameters using ASCII.
# The parameter must be quoted if it includes whitespace.
#
# Configuration syntax:
# Leading whitespace is ignored.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Lines ending with '\' are concatenated with the next line.
# Bracketed ([]) names define sections

[Global]
  # Users can restrict work items to only run on certain cores by
  #  specifying a ReactorMask.  Default ReactorMask mask is defined as
  #  -c option in the 'ealargs' setting at beginning of file nvmf_tgt.c.
  #ReactorMask 0x00FF

  # Tracepoint group mask for spdk trace buffers
  # Default: 0x0 (all tracepoint groups disabled)
  # Set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to enable all tracepoint groups.
  #TpointGroupMask 0x0

[Rpc]
  # Defines whether to enable configuration via RPC.
  # Default is disabled.  Note that the RPC interface is not
  # authenticated, so users should be careful about enabling
  # RPC in non-trusted environments.
  Enable No
  # Listen address for the RPC service.
  # May be an IP address or an absolute path to a Unix socket.
  Listen 127.0.0.1

# Users may change this section to create a different number or size of
#  malloc LUNs.
# This will generate 8 LUNs with a malloc-allocated backend.
# Each LUN will be size 64MB and these will be named
# Malloc0 through Malloc7.  Not all LUNs defined here are necessarily
#  used below.
[Malloc]
  NumberOfLuns 8
  LunSizeInMB 64

# Users must change this section to match the /dev/sdX devices to be
# exported as iSCSI LUNs. The devices are accessed using Linux AIO.
# The format is:
# AIO <file name> <bdev name>
# The file name is the backing device
# The bdev name can be referenced from elsewhere in the configuration file.
# Block size may be omitted to automatically detect the block size of a disk.

  # Set the maximum number of submission and completion queues per session.
  # Setting this to '8', for example, allows for 8 submission and 8 completion queues
  # per session.
  MaxQueuesPerSession 4

  # Set the maximum number of outstanding I/O per queue.

  # Set the maximum in-capsule data size. Must be a multiple of 16.
  # 0 is a valid choice.

  # Set the global acceptor lcore ID, lcores are numbered starting at 0.
  #AcceptorCore 0

  # Set how often the acceptor polls for incoming connections. The acceptor is also
  # responsible for polling existing connections that have gone idle. 0 means continuously
  # poll. Units in microseconds.
  AcceptorPollRate 10000

[Nvme]
  # NVMe Device Whitelist
  # Users may specify which NVMe devices to claim by their transport id.
  # See spdk_nvme_transport_id_parse() in spdk/nvme.h for the correct format.
  # The second argument is the assigned name, which can be referenced from
  # other sections in the configuration file. For NVMe devices, a namespace
  # is automatically appended to each name in the format <YourName>nY, where
  # Y is the NSID (starts at 1).

  TransportId "trtype:PCIe traddr:0000:01:00.0" Nvme1

  # The number of attempts per I/O when an I/O fails. Do not include
  # this key to get the default behavior.
  RetryCount 4
  # Timeout for each command, in seconds. If 0, don't track timeouts.
  Timeout 0
  # Action to take on command time out. Only valid when Timeout is greater
  # than 0. This may be 'Reset' to reset the controller, 'Abort' to abort
  # the command, or 'None' to just print a message but do nothing.
  # Admin command timeouts will always result in a reset.
  ActionOnTimeout None
  # Set how often the admin queue is polled for asynchronous events.
  # Units in microseconds.
  AdminPollRate 100000

  # Disable handling of hotplug (runtime insert and remove) events,
  # users can set to Yes if want to enable it.
  # Default: No
  HotplugEnable No

# The Split virtual block device slices block devices into multiple smaller bdevs.
[Split]
  # Syntax:
  #   Split <bdev> <count> [<size_in_megabytes>]

  # Split Malloc2 into two equally-sized portions, Malloc2p0 and Malloc2p1
  Split Malloc2 2

  # Split Malloc3 into eight 1-megabyte portions, Malloc3p0 ... Malloc3p7,
  # leaving the rest of the device inaccessible
  Split Malloc3 8 1

# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Core may be set or not. If set, the specified subsystem will run on
#   it, otherwise each subsystem will use a round-robin method to allocate
#   core from available cores,  lcores are numbered starting at 0.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Exactly 1 NVMe directive specifying an NVMe device by PCI BDF. The
#   PCI domain:bus:device.function can be replaced by "*" to indicate
#   any PCI device.
