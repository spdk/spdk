# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Between 0 and 255 Namespace directives are allowed. These define the
#   namespaces accessible from this subsystem.
#   The user must specify MaxNamespaces to allow for adding namespaces
#   during active connection. By default it is 0
#   The user must specify a bdev name for each namespace, and may optionally
#   specify a namespace ID. If nsid is omitted, the namespace will be
#   assigned the next available NSID. The NSID must be unique within the
#   subsystem. An optional namespace UUID may also be specified.
#   Syntax:
#     Namespace <bdev_name> [<nsid> [<uuid>]]
