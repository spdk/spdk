[Global]
  # Users can restrict work items to only run on certain cores by
  #  specifying a ReactorMask.  Default ReactorMask mask is defined as
  #  -c option in the 'ealargs' setting at beginning of file nvmf_tgt.c.
  #ReactorMask 0x00FF

  # Tracepoint group mask for spdk trace buffers
  # Default: 0x0 (all tracepoint groups disabled)
  # Set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to enable all tracepoint groups.
  #TpointGroupMask 0x0

  # PciBlacklist and PciWhitelist cannot be used at the same time

# Users may change this section to create a different number or size of
#  malloc LUNs.
# This will generate 8 LUNs with a malloc-allocated backend.
# Each LUN will be size 64MB and these will be named
# Malloc0 through Malloc7.  Not all LUNs defined here are necessarily

# Users must change this section to match the /dev/sdX devices to be
# exported as iSCSI LUNs. The devices are accessed using Linux AIO.
# The format is:
# AIO <file name> <bdev name>
# The file name is the backing device
# The bdev name can be referenced from elsewhere in the configuration file.
# Block size may be omitted to automatically detect the block size of a disk.

[Nvme]
  # NVMe Device Whitelist
  # Users may specify which NVMe devices to claim by their transport id.
  # See spdk_nvme_transport_id_parse() in spdk/nvme.h for the correct format.
  # The second argument is the assigned name, which can be referenced from

  # is automatically appended to each name in the format <YourName>nY, where
  # Y is the NSID (starts at 1).

  Timeout 0
  # Action to take on command time out. Only valid when Timeout is greater

  # the command, or 'None' to just print a message but do nothing.
  # Admin command timeouts will always result in a reset.

# The Split virtual block device slices block devices into multiple smaller bdevs.

# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Between 0 and 255 Namespace directives are allowed. These define the
#   namespaces accessible from this subsystem.
#   The user must specify MaxNamespaces to allow for adding namespaces
#   during active connection. By default it is 0
#   The user must specify a bdev name for each namespace, and may optionally
#   specify a namespace ID. If nsid is omitted, the namespace will be
#   assigned the next available NSID. The NSID must be unique within the
#   subsystem. An optional namespace UUID may also be specified.
#   Syntax:
#     Namespace <bdev_name> [<nsid> [<uuid>]]
