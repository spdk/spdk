# Please write all parameters using ASCII.
# The parameter must be quoted if it includes whitespace.

# Configuration syntax:
# Leading whitespace is ignored.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Lines ending with '\' are concatenated with the next line.
# Bracketed ([]) names define sections

[Global]
  # Users can restrict work items to only run on certain cores by
  #  specifying a ReactorMask.  Default ReactorMask mask is defined as
  #  -c option in the 'ealargs' setting at beginning of file nvmf_tgt.c.
  #ReactorMask 0x00FF

  # Tracepoint group mask for spdk trace buffers
  # Default: 0x0 (all tracepoint groups disabled)
  # Set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to enable all tracepoint groups.
  #TpointGroupMask 0x0

  # syslog facility
  LogFacility "local7"

[Rpc]
  # Defines whether to enable configuration via RPC.
  # Default is disabled.  Note that the RPC interface is not
  # authenticated, so users should be careful about enabling
  # RPC in non-trusted environments.
  Enable No
  # Listen address for the RPC service.
  # May be an IP address or an absolute path to a Unix socket.
  Listen 127.0.0.1

# Users may change this section to create a different number or size of
#  malloc LUNs.
# This will generate 8 LUNs with a malloc-allocated backend.
# Each LUN will be size 64MB and these will be named
# Malloc0 through Malloc7.  Not all LUNs defined here are necessarily
#  used below.

# Define NVMf protocol global options

  # Set the maximum number of submission and completion queues per session.
  # Setting this to '8', for example, allows for 8 submission and 8 completion queues
  # per session.
  MaxQueuesPerSession 4

  # Set the maximum number of outstanding I/O per queue.
  #MaxQueueDepth 128

  # Set the maximum in-capsule data size. Must be a multiple of 16.
  #InCapsuleDataSize 4096

  # Set the maximum I/O size. Must be a multiple of 4096.
  #MaxIOSize 131072

  # Set the global acceptor lcore ID, lcores are numbered starting at 0.
  #AcceptorCore 0

  # Set how often the acceptor polls for incoming connections. The acceptor is also
  # responsible for polling existing connections that have gone idle. 0 means continuously
  # poll. Units in microseconds.
  AcceptorPollRate 10000

  # Registers the application to receive timeout callback and to reset the controller.
  ResetControllerOnTimeout Yes
  # Timeout value.
  NvmeTimeoutValue 30

# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Core may be set or not. If set, the specified subsystem will run on
#   it, otherwise each subsystem will use a round-robin method to allocate
#   core from available cores,  lcores are numbered starting at 0.
# - Mode may be either "Direct" or "Virtual". Direct means that physical
#   devices attached to the target will be presented to hosts as if they
#   were directly attached to the host. No software emulation or command
#   validation is performed. Virtual means that an NVMe controller is
#   emulated in software and the namespaces it contains map to block devices
#   on the target system. These block devices do not need to be NVMe devices.
#   Only Direct mode is currently supported.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect.
# - Exactly 1 NVMe directive specifying an NVMe device by PCI BDF. The
#   PCI domain:bus:device.function can be replaced by "*" to indicate
#   any PCI device.
