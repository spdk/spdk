# Users must change the PortalGroup section(s) to match the IP addresses

# PortalGroup sections define which network portals the iSCSI target
#  will use to listen for incoming connections.  These are also used to
#  determine which targets are accessible over each portal group.
# Up to 1024 portal directives are allowed.  These define the network
#  portals of the portal group. The user must specify a IP address
#  for each network portal, and may optionally specify a port and
#  a cpumask. If the port is omitted, 3260 will be used. Cpumask will
#  be used to set the processor affinity of the iSCSI connection
#  through the portal.  If the cpumask is omitted, cpumask will be
#  set to all available processors.
#  Syntax:
#    Portal <Name> <IP address>[:<port>[@<cpumask>]]
