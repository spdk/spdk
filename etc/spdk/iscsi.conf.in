# Users must change the PortalGroup section(s) to match the IP addresses

# PortalGroup sections define which network portals the iSCSI target

# Up to 1024 portal directives are allowed.  These define the network
#  portals of the portal group. The user must specify a IP address
#  for each network portal, and may optionally specify a port and
#  a cpumask. If the port is omitted, 3260 will be used. Cpumask will
#  be used to set the processor affinity of the iSCSI connection
#  through the portal.  If the cpumask is omitted, cpumask will be
#  set to all available processors.
