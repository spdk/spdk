      "message": "The reason for this change was to easily use the default when empty option was provided (e.g. detect_cc.sh --cc\u003d would use cc instead of empty string). The script is called before any of the defaults are set, so it was called with empty LD_TYPE and it was easier (and cleaner) to allow empty options than to modify its call inside the Makefile. Anyway, since I\u0027m changing the script to use LD instead of LD_TYPE, I\u0027ll revert it (CC, CXX, and LD are implicitly defined by make to cc, cxx and ld respectively).",
