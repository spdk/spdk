      "message": "This function gets called each time the poll group is polled.\n\nIf a queue pair was disconnected, but still had I/O outstanding, then the first time it went into spdk_nvmf_rdma_qpair_destroy it just set the qpair_disconnected flag and returned. Then, each time spdk_nvmf_rdma_qpair_process_pending is called it attempts to destroy the qpair again here. If the qpair has no I/O outstanding, this will actually destroy it. Otherwise, it will just return again.",
