      "message": "I noticed having now \u003d spdk_get_ticks() here was causing performance drop up to 25%. It was coming from running context_switch_monitor timer poller running all the time. Looks like having now here caused timer poller execution to not function correctly as expected. in-lining it seem to solve it. I could take 2 variable approach as well, but thought in-lining is OK.",

      "message": "Why does now \u003d spdk_get_ticks() cause a 25% performance drop though?  It can\u0027t just be saving it in a local variable.  It must be the updating \u0027now\u0027 here causes problems elsewhere.\n\nI\u0027d like to understand this more through before we proceed further on committing this patch.",
