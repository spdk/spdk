      "message": "It\u0027s set in ocssd_io_init_md(read|write).\n\nThe metadata referred by the OCSSD_IO_MD flag is not the one specified by the NVMe specification that is tied to a read or write. This is FTL\u0027s metadata that is transferred using regular reads/writes, which is used to restore the L2P from the SSD. It\u0027s written at the beginning of each band as well as its end. Dropping the support for this kind of metadata in the first patch and adding it in a later one would be really hard, as it\u0027s core to the whole operation of the FTL and would require substantial amount of work.",
