      "message": "One common reason for the readv or writev calls to fail is that they\u0027ve run out of resources and are unable to allocate more. That means there is a reasonable chance that this calloc is also going to fail. I think a better strategy for handling these low memory conditions is to embed the bdev_io_wait structure and other necessary information into the spdk_vhost_blk_task object, so you always have it available without doing an allocation.",
