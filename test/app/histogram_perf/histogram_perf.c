 * This applications is a simple test app used to test the performance of
 *  tallying datapoints with struct spdk_histogram_data.  It can be used
 *  to measure the effect of changes to the spdk_histogram_data implementation.
 *
 * There are no command line parameters currently - it just tallies
 *  datapoints for 10 seconds in a default-sized histogram structure and
 *  then prints out the number of tallies performed.
