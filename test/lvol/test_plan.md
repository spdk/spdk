# Lvol feature test plan

## Objective
The purpose of these tests is to verify the possibility of using lvol configuration in SPDK.

## Methodology
Configuration in test is to be done using example stub application.
All management is done using RPC calls, including logical volumes management.
All tests are performed using malloc backends.
One exception to malloc backends are tests for logical volume
tasting - these require persistent merory like NVMe backend.

Tests will be executed as scenarios - sets of smaller test step
in which return codes from RPC calls is validated.
Some configuration calls may also be validated by use of
"get_*" RPC calls, which provide additional information for verifying
results.

  destroy existing lvol store,
  verify removal results using get_lvol_stores and get_bdevs commands
- re-create initial configuration by repeating steps 2-5:
  create lvol store on NVMe bdev, create four lvol bdevs on lvol store and
  verify all configuration call results
- clean running configuration:
  delete all lvol bdevs,
  destroy lvol store
  verify removal results using get_lvol_stores and get_bdevs commands
