      "message": "Please employ the URL fragment formatted source line as previously requested.   That results in the base filename on github (e.g. v18.10.tar.gz) to become renamed to spdk-18.10.1.tar.gz in the SOURCES subdirectory of the rpmbuild tree tree.   Such naming is consistent with other packages and is also helpful when one is building multiple rpm\u0027s from a single rpmbuild tree.   In other words, if one were otherwise to inspect the SOURCES subdir of the rpmbuild tree and only see a tarball named, \"v18.10.1.tar.gz\", then one has no idea (without the leading spdk- prefix) to know the contents without inspecting it via a tar cmd.",
