      "message": "It would be good to describe this concept somewhere, but I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s better in doc/bdev.md, rather than the RPC documentation.\n\nIt can be a bit confusing.  For example, if you call construct_lvol_store with a bdev name that does not exist yet, it will immediately fail - it won\u0027t wait for that bdev to show up.  I think that is the correct behavior, but we need to have this described somewhere, and probably call out which bdev modules follow which process.  I think it can be summarized that virtual bdev construct calls that require writing metadata to the bdev *must* specify a bdev that is currently present.",
