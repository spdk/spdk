      "message": "Hi Maciek,\n\nI think the code you\u0027ve moved to common.c in this patch makes sense.  I\u0027m not as sure about this new common_rpc.c file though.  I was thinking that eventually, all of the RPCs in bdev_nvme_rpc.c would be \"common\".  I\u0027m just wondering if we should just keep this code in bdev_nvme_rpc.c for now.\n\nWe needed to separate out code into common.c/common.h, because both standard and ftl .c files needed to call functions there.  But RPCs are different - they aren\u0027t called by the standard and ftl .c files.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n-Jim",
