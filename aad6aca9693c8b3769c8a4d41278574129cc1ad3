      "message": "Shouldn we change last parameter to MSG_DONTWAIT?\n\nI don\u0027t see where we mark client-\u003esockfd as O_NONBLOCK so each of these calls would be blocking.  I guess this was OK for the original code which is running in a blocking environment.  But if this is going into an SPDK poller, do we want it to be non-blocking?\n\nOr maybe we just want this to be blocking for now, so you don\u0027t have to worry about out-of-order RPC completions.  I\u0027m fine with that.  Just wanted to see what your thoughts were on this.",
