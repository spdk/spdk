      "message": "You mentioned earlier that we will run into the issue where we create multiple vms all with virtio images; to that end, I think we could probably make these filenames (if not the paths) configurable. \nI am imagining that after this change is in we will create a top level bash script that will call down to this script, then create_vbox.sh relying on the files for each test pool vm it creates.\n\nI am good if we do this in this patch, or in a later one when we have a better idea of what the calling script will look like.",
