      "message": "Once all extent pages have been read, num_clusters_in_et \u003d\u003d 0?  That doesn\u0027t seem right to me.  It means if someone looks at this field after the blob has been loaded, it will say there are 0 clusters in the extent table.\n\nShould we have a separate field in spdk_blob (not part of mut_data structure) that tracks number of remaining clusters to be read from extent pages?  At least to me, the mut_data structure represents the data that is going to be persistent to metadata at some point - it\u0027s not used to track information needed while we are loading the blob.",
