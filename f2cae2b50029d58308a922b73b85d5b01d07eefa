      "message": "If you take my comment from above, then the only way rc !\u003d 0 and we didn\u0027t call nvme_ctrlr_fail is at line 973, when ctrlr-\u003eis_removed \u003d\u003d true.  But in that case, haven\u0027t we already called nvme_ctrlr_fail() when the device was removed?\n\nSo I\u0027m just wondering if you need this check here at all.  Which then means nvme_ctrlr_reset becomes spdk_nvme_ctrlr_reset and this function goes away.",
