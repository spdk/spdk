# vhost Getting Started Guide {#vhost_getting_started}

The Storage Performance Development Kit vhost application is named "vhost".
This application extends SPDK to present virtio-scsi controllers to QEMU-based
VMs and process I/O submitted to devices attached to those controllers.

# Prerequisites {#vhost_prereqs}

The base SPDK build instructions are located README.md in SPDK main directory.
This guide assumes familiarity with building SPDK using the default options.

## Supported Guest Operating Systems
The guest OS must contain virtio drivers. The SPDK vhost target has been tested
with Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 25, Windows 2012 R2.

# Building

## SPDK
The vhost target is built by default.  To enable/disable building the vhost
target, either modify the following line in the CONFIG file in the root directory:

~~~
    CONFIG_VHOST?=y
~~~

Or specify on the command line:

~~~
    make CONFIG_VHOST=y
~~~

Once built, the binary will be at `app/vhost/vhost`.

## QEMU

Vhost functionality is dependent on QEMU patches to enable vhost-scsi in
userspace - those patches are currently working their way through the QEMU
mailing list, but temporary patches to enable this functionality are available
in the spdk branch at https://github.com/spdk/qemu.

# Configuration {#vhost_config}

## SPDK
A `vhost` specific configuration file is used to configure the SPDK vhost
target.  A fully documented example configuration file is located at
`etc/spdk/vhost.conf.in`.  This file defines the following:

### Storage Backends
Storage backends are block devices which will be exposed as SCSI LUNs on
devices attached to the vhost-scsi controller.  SPDK supports several different
types of storage backends, including NVMe, Linux AIO, malloc ramdisk and Ceph
RBD.  Refer to @ref bdev_getting_started for additional information on
specifying storage backends in the configuration file.

### Mappings Between SCSI Controllers and Storage Backends
The vhost target is exposing SCSI controllers to the virtual machines.
Each device in the vhost controller is associated with an SPDK block device and
configuration file defines those associations.  The block device to Dev mappings
are specified in the configuration file as:

~~~
[VhostScsiX]
  Name vhost.X          # Name of vhost socket
  Dev 0 BackendX        # "BackendX" is block device name from previous
                        # sections in config file
  Dev 1 BackendY
  ...
  Dev n BackendN
  #Cpumask 0x1          # Optional parameter defining which core controller uses

~~~

### Vhost Sockets
Userspace vhost uses UNIX domain sockets for communication between QEMU
and the vhost target.  Each vhost controller is associated with a UNIX domain
socket file with filename equal to the Name argument in configuration file.
Sockets are created at current directory when starting the SPDK vhost target.

### Core Affinity Configuration
Vhost target can be restricted to run on certain cores by specifying a ReactorMask.
Default is to allow vhost target work on core 0. For NUMA systems it is essential
to run vhost with cores on each socket to achieve optimal performance.

To specify which core each controller should use, it can be defined by optional
Cpumask parameter in configuration file.  For NUMA systems the Cpumask should
specify cores on the same CPU socket as its associated VM.

## QEMU

Userspace vhost-scsi adds the following command line option for QEMU:
~~~
       -device vhost-user-scsi-pci,id=scsi0,chardev=char0
~~~

In order to start qemu with vhost you need to specify following options:

 - Socket, which QEMU will use for vhost communication with SPDK:
~~~
       -chardev socket,id=char0,path=/path/to/vhost/socket
~~~

 - Hugepages to share memory between vm and vhost target
~~~
       -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=1G,mem-path=/dev/hugepages,share=on
~~~

# Running Vhost Target
To get started, the following example is usually sufficient:
~~~
app/vhost/vhost -c /path/to/vhost.conf
~~~

A full list of command line arguments to vhost can be obtained by:
~~~
app/vhost/vhost -h
~~~


## Example
Assume that qemu and spdk are in respectively `qemu` and `spdk` directories.
~~~
     ./qemu/build/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 \
             -m 1024 \
             -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=1G,mem-path=/dev/hugepages,share=on \
             -numa node,memdev=mem \
             -drive file=$PROJECTS/os.qcow2,if=none,id=disk \
             -device ide-hd,drive=disk,bootindex=0 \
             -chardev socket,id=char0,path=./spdk/vhost.0 \
             -device vhost-user-scsi-pci,id=scsi0,chardev=char0 \
             --enable-kvm

# Experimental features {#vhost_experimental}

## Multi-Queue Block Layer (blk_mq)
It is possible to use multiqueue feature in vhost.
To enable it on linux it is required to modify kernel options inside
virtual machine.

Instructions below for Ubuntu OS:
1. `vi /etc/default/grub`
2. Make sure mq is enabled:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1"
3. `sudo update-grub`
4. Reboot virtual machine

To achieve better performance make sure to increase number of cores
assigned to vm.

# Known bugs and limitations {#vhost_bugs}

## Hot plug is not supported
Hot plug is not supported in vhost yet. Event queue path doesn't handle that
case yet.
