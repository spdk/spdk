# vhost {#vhost}

# vhost Users Guide {#vhost_users_guide}

The Storage Performance Development Kit vhost application is named `vhost`.
This application extends SPDK to present virtio storage controllers to QEMU-based
VMs and process I/O submitted to devices attached to those controllers.

# Prerequisites {#vhost_prereqs}

This guide assumes the SPDK has been built according to the instructions in @ref
getting_started.  The SPDK vhost target is built with the default configure options.

## Supported Guest Operating Systems

The guest OS must contain virtio-scsi or virtio-blk drivers.  Most Linux and FreeBSD
distributions include virtio drivers.
[Windows virtio drivers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Windows_Virtio_Drivers) must be
installed separately.  The SPDK vhost target has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora
25, and Windows 2012 R2.

## QEMU

Userspace vhost-scsi target support was added to upstream QEMU in v2.10.0.
Userspace vhost-blk target support is not yet upstream in QEMU, but patches
are available in SPDK's QEMU repository:

~~~{.sh}
git clone -b spdk https://github.com/spdk/qemu
cd qemu
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
~~~

# Configuration {#vhost_config}

## SPDK

A vhost-specific configuration file is used to configure the SPDK vhost
target.  A fully documented example configuration file is located at
`etc/spdk/vhost.conf.in`.  This file defines the following:

### Storage Backends

Storage backends are devices which will be exposed to the guest OS.
Vhost-blk backends are exposed as block devices in the guest OS, and vhost-scsi backends are
exposed as SCSI LUNs on devices attached to the vhost-scsi controller in the guest OS.
SPDK supports several different types of storage backends, including NVMe,
Linux AIO, malloc ramdisk and Ceph RBD.  Refer to @ref bdev_getting_started for
additional information on specifying storage backends in the configuration file.

### Mappings Between Block Controllers and Storage Backends

The vhost target exposes block devices to the virtual machines.
The device in the vhost controller is associated with an SPDK block device, and the
configuration file defines those associations.  The block device to Dev mapping
is specified in the configuration file as:

~~~
[VhostBlkX]
  Name vhost.X          # Name of vhost socket
  Dev BackendX          # "BackendX" is block device name from previous
                        # sections in config file
  #Cpumask 0x1          # Optional parameter defining which core controller uses
~~~

### Mappings Between SCSI Controllers and Storage Backends

The vhost target exposes SCSI controllers to the virtual machines.
Each device in the vhost controller is associated with an SPDK block device and
configuration file defines those associations.  The block device to Dev mappings
are specified in the configuration file as:

~~~
[VhostScsiX]
  Name vhost.X          # Name of vhost socket
  Dev 0 BackendX        # "BackendX" is block device name from previous
                        # sections in config file
  Dev 1 BackendY
  ...
  Dev n BackendN
  #Cpumask 0x1          # Optional parameter defining which core controller uses
~~~

### Vhost Sockets

Userspace vhost uses UNIX domain sockets for communication between QEMU
and the vhost target.  Each vhost controller is associated with a UNIX domain
socket file with filename equal to the Name argument in configuration file.
Sockets are created at current working directory when starting the SPDK vhost
target.

### Core Affinity Configuration

Vhost target can be restricted to run on certain cores by specifying a `ReactorMask`.
Default is to allow vhost target work on core 0. For NUMA systems, it is essential
to run vhost with cores on each socket to achieve optimal performance.

Each controller may be assigned a set of cores using the optional
`Cpumask` parameter in configuration file.  For NUMA systems, the Cpumask should
specify cores on the same CPU socket as its associated VM. The `vhost` application will
pick one core from `ReactorMask` masked by `Cpumask`. `Cpumask` must be a subset of
`ReactorMask`.

## QEMU

Userspace vhost-scsi adds the following command line option for QEMU:
~~~
-device vhost-user-scsi-pci,id=scsi0,chardev=char0[,num_queues=N]
~~~

Userspace vhost-blk adds the following command line option for QEMU:
~~~
-device vhost-user-blk-pci,logical_block_size=4096,size=512M,chardev=char0[,num_queues=N]
~~~

In order to start qemu with vhost you need to specify following options:

 - Socket, which QEMU will use for vhost communication with SPDK:
~~~
-chardev socket,id=char0,path=/path/to/vhost/socket
~~~

 - Hugepages to share memory between vm and vhost target
~~~
-object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=1G,mem-path=/dev/hugepages,share=on
~~~

# Running Vhost Target

To get started, the following example is usually sufficient:
~~~
app/vhost/vhost -c /path/to/vhost.conf
~~~

A full list of command line arguments to vhost can be obtained by:
~~~
app/vhost/vhost -h
~~~

## Multi-Queue Block Layer (blk-mq)

For best performance use the Linux kernel block multi-queue feature with vhost.
To enable it on Linux, it is required to modify kernel options inside the
virtual machine.

Instructions below for Ubuntu OS:
1. `vi /etc/default/grub`
2. Make sure mq is enabled:
`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1"`
3. `sudo update-grub`
4. Reboot virtual machine

To achieve better performance, make sure to increase number of cores
assigned to the VM and add `num_queues` parameter to the QEMU `device`. It should be enough
to set `num_queues=4` to saturate physical device. Adding too many queues might lead to SPDK
vhost performance degradation if many vhost devices are used because each device will require
additional `num_queues` to be polled.

# Example {#vhost_example}

Run SPDK vhost with two controllers: Virtio SCSI and Virtio block.

Virtio SCSI controller with two LUNs:

- SCSI target 1, LUN 0 backed by Malloc0 bdev
- SCSI target 5, LUN 0 backed by Malloc1 bdev

Virtio block device backed by Malloc2 bdev

For better performance use 4 VCPU (`-smp 4`) and 4 queues for each controller
(`num_queues=4`). Assume that QEMU and SPDK are in respectively `qemu` and `spdk` directories.

# Known bugs and limitations {#vhost_bugs}

## Windows virtio-blk driver before version 0.1.130-1 only works with 512-byte sectors

The Windows `viostor` driver before version 0.1.130-1 is buggy and does not
correctly support vhost-blk devices with non-512-byte block size.
See the [bug report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1411092) for
more information.
