      "message": "Sure, I just put some more description in the commit message. In one of subsequent patches I introduced a per-base tailq and I had to put it in some struct. Without this particular patch, no matter where I would have put it, the remove_cb wouldn\u0027t have any access to it (unless it did some kind of sad lookup). Now that there\u0027s the part base in the remove_cb callback, the upper layer can just call it spdk_bdev_part_base_get_ctx(part_base) and get access to whatever it allocated and passed here.",
