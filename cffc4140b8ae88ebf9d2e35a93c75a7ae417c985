      "message": "This is just a food for thought, but using proper evaluation constracts for arithmetic checks, e.g. `(( VERSION_ID \u003e foo ))`, etc. would be of more benefit I think (not in this particular case maybe but in more general scope of things).  Also, combining this into single expression, like `(( VERSION_ID \u003e 1400 \u0026\u0026 VERSION_ID \u003c 1900 ))` would be a bit clearer imho too. :)",
