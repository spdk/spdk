      "message": "Do you mean max_queue_depth * max_sge?\n\nEither way, putting this data here is probably not the best spot. Why pool all sge elements into the qpair struct if you allocate enough for the worst case anyway? It would be a lot clearer if you put them into spdk_nvmf_rdma_request where they were before. Instead of having this in the request:\n\nstruct {\n    struct ibv_send_wr wr;\n    struct ibv_sge sgl[NVMF_DEFAULT_TX_SGE];\n} data;\n\nDo this:\n\nstruct {\n    struct ibv_send_wr wr;\n    struct ibv_sge *sgl;\n} data;\n\nAnd then allocate the sgl array when the request array is initialized.\n\nIf you can live with the number of sgl elements being a #define, it gets even simpler.",
