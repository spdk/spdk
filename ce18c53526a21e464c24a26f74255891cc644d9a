      "message": "not sure what Ben\u0027s original intention was for this field but I\u0027m guessing to guess this probably isn\u0027t it. Are you trying to use this as a flag that the page is valid? We have an unused crc field that would be a better option I think but should probably be its own patch.  If we were to use a flag like this in functional code (little different for test code) I don\u0027t think I\u0027d go with this value and I\u0027d make it a private #define as well",
