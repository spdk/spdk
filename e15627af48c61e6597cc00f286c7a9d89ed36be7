      "message": "I didn\u0027t realize cluster_size was stored as uint32_t on disk - we should probably do this change as a separate patch, since it\u0027s changing the on-disk format and will break compatibility with any existing blobstores. \n\nTo avoid breaking compatibility, it might be better to add a new uint64_t field, cluster_size_u64, later in the struct and set the 32-bit cluster_size to a special value (UINT32_MAX?) to indicate that the value is too large to be stored in the existing cluster_size field, and therefore the uint64_t version should be used.\n\nOtherwise, we\u0027d need to bump the version to indicate an incompatible format change.\n\nThis also needs an update to doc/blob.md to describe the change to the on-disk format.",
