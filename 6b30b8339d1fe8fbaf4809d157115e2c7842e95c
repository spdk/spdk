      "message": "I\u0027m concerned about what the optimizer will do here. I know header is marked volatile, but since nothing depends on the value of reg I\u0027m worried about someone in the future setting aggressive optimization levels (O3 or O4) and this read going away for that reason. One idea is to read the value into reg and compare it to the expected value. Then code actually depends on the value of reg.\n\nFor example:\n\nheader-\u003eone.mem_base \u003d 0xfff0;\nif (header-\u003eone.mem_base !\u003d 0xfff0) {\n    goto err;\n}\n\nYou could wrap this in a little macro in this function:\n\n#define MMIO_SYNC_WRITE(reg, value) \\\n    reg \u003d value;                    \\\n    if (reg !\u003d value) {             \\\n        goto err;                   \\\n    }\n\nand then you\u0027d have a bunch of these:\n\nMMIO_SYNC_WRITE(header-\u003eone.mem_base, 0xfff0);\n\nThe if statement won\u0027t get optimized out because of the volatile marking, I\u0027m at least confident in that part.\n\nYou could make this generic for use anywhere by additionally letting the user pass in the goto label for use in the error path.",

      "message": "I had similar concern as you but this patch was just a quick fix to enable VMD tests. I have plan to move all of this reads and writes of CFG reg (there are more in different parts of code) to some wrapper function. There is one issue with macro you proposed - we do not have guarantee that read from register will return same value as we write e.g. writing 0xffff to BAR could return 0xff00 and this is used to calculate memory size.",

      "message": "I think I agree with Wojciech - we should add a wrapper function for all cfg accesses and use it consistently throughout the entire driver. This should be done outside of this patch.",
