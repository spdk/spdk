      "message": "I think for best performance with DIF enabled - we want to increase size of buffers in small data buffer pool also.  With 8192 as default, it means when DIF is enabled, really only 4KB I/O will use buffers from the small pool, since 8KB + DIF metadata will need to use the large pool.  (I\u0027m not counting I/O such as 4.5K or 5K.)\n\nBut I think for now we should just increase the buffer sizes unilaterally to what is needed for DIF.  I know it adds some small amount of additional memory (3% or so) but then DIF just works without needing to configure specifically for DIF.\n\nWhat do you think Shuhei?  In general I am OK with dynamic buffer sizes, but am not sure it\u0027s critical to enable DIF.  Please let me know your opinion.",
