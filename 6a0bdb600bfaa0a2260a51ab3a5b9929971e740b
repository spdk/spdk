      "message": "Hi Ben, Thank you, I didn\u0027t notice that.\n\nThis patch was extracted from a patch to add JSON-RPC to initialize iSCSI subsystem.  However as we discussed today, I abandon JSON-RPC based subsystem initialization and I want to wait for Pawel\u0027s idea before updating this patch. Hence your feedback will be directly usable later.\n\nThanks,\nShuhei",
