      "message": "if you can\u0027t break from this function, would it be easier to just do STAILQ_FOREACH, and then do an STAILQ_INIT after that loop is done?\n\nI also think it would be somewhat more clear to do STAILQ_REMOVE instead of STAILQ_REMOVE_HEAD.  Using STAILQ_REMOVE_HEAD with STAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE makes me want to go read the queue.h code to make sure I really know how those two work together.",
