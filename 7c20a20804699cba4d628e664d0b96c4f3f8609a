      "message": "I\u0027d prefer that the link actually said \"spdk.io\" instead of \"SPDK Website\". I think spdk.io is pretty easy to remember and it may just stick in people\u0027s heads.\n\nI like the old paragraph that explained what SPDK was better than this one, but I\u0027m very open to tweaks to improve it. Maybe we make a list of the things we want the opening paragraph to accomplish that the old one doesn\u0027t and go from there?",
