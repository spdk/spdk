      "message": "general comment: I haven\u0027t seen how you\u0027re using these yet but globals should be avoided if possible, especially in UT code as you may end creating dependencies between tests that you didn\u0027t intend and may not expose until they get reordered at some point in the future for some reason. If you have to use them, for good reason, then you should name them so that their scope is clear like with a g_ or something but I\u0027ll defer to maintainers for the recommendation there since I don\u0027t know how consistently that practice is enforced",

      "message": "So I\u0027m not a big fan of using these prep/clean functions in our env as the only use here at least is dealing with globals.  Will defer to maintainers on whether or not they want to merge this. We do have some globals used elsewhere but individual tests generally alloc/free them or use them as ptrs only and NULL them wen they\u0027re done. Not a big deal though, see what others think...",

      "message": "the name convention for these functions should be \"test_\u003cname of function being tested\" \n\nThis is pretty consistently followed in all the other test code and makes it easy for anyone to jump back and forth between UT code and code under test and know what goes with what.\n\nI have a series of UT patches that are pending now, please review one of them for an example of what we\u0027re going for with all UT moving forward.  https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/372554/",
