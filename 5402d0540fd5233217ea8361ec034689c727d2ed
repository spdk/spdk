      "message": "is this ERRLOG required?  I don\u0027t think this should ever happen, so maybe it is good to keep the ERRLOG just in case\n\nbut I was thinking maybe this whole function could be simplified - just loop over the raid_bdev-\u003enum_base_bdevs, and don\u0027t even look at the raid_cfg; this is called as part of deleting the raid_cfg anyways, so it could be much simpler code if we just cleanup whatever bdevs were opened, and not try to match them up with the raid_cfg\n\nthis is just an idea - there may be some key points I am missing",
