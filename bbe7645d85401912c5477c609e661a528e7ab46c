      "message": "Hi Vitaly,\n\nI like this change.  But could we split it into two patches?  I feel like this patch is both moving the feature masks from the backend to the vdev structure, as well as changing how some of these #defines are initially defined and passed to rte_vhost.\n\nTake VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO for example.  Previously we would set this flag in both virtio_features and disabled_features.  This gets passed to vhost_dev_register.  That will make this flag set in DPDK\u0027s supported_features, but clear it in features.\n\nBut now with this patch, if RO isn\u0027t set, then VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO is never set in supported_features.\n\nMaybe the new method is better, but I think it could use a bit more explaining at least, if not separating into multiple patches.  I always find how we specify these feature flags a bit \nconfusing.  :-)\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
