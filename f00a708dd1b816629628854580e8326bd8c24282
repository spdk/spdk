But we will have no code to test any of these changes, and no API where a user could actually perform such an operation.\n\nSo let\u0027s keep the code simpler.  In general we should not be adding code that we cannot test.\n\nThis also adds extra memory allocations in the I/O path which I don\u0027t think we needed previously.",
