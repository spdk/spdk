Shouldn\u0027t we always just try to set the channel here?",

      "message": "For now, adding subsystems and namespaces to poll groups is asynchronous but the user has no way to wait for their completion (I\u0027ll add that later). That means a user could add a subsystem then add two namespaces all synchronously, and by the time this function executes on the poll group the events from the initial subsystem creation may have already created the I/O channel. It\u0027s a mess until I fix the APIs.\n\nI\u0027ll zero the memory though.",
