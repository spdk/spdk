# py-spdk
## Problem description

As we all know, SPDK is a high-performance kit written in c. It is hard for
management-level applications written in python to connect with SPDK-based
app (as: nvmf_tgt, etc.) directly. For this reason, developers should be able
to provide a client for callers to make convenient use of SPDK-based app. The
py-spdk is such a python client that is designed for the upper-level management
applications to communicate more fully and get data returned by SPDK-based app.

## Use case

The py-spdk is designed for all of the management-level applications to employ
SPDK-based app better. For example:

* As an acceleration framework, the OpenStack Cyborg should be able to find
and report the ability of backend accelerators including hardware  (like FPGA)
and software (like DPDK, SPDK) acceleration resources. Based on this reason,
the py-spdk can make the Cyborg interact with SPDK-based app (as: nvmf_tgt,
vhost, etc.). According to the configuration file provided by the Cyborg, the
py-spdk will to be informed whether the SPDK is installed. If so, then it will
judge further whether the nvmf_tgt process is started. Suppose the nvmf_tgt
server is not alive, it will execute the functions of initialization and
startup for server. Once the server is successfully started, the py-spdk can
obtain what it requires, and then do other operations.

## Proposed change

In general, the goal is to develop the py-spdk that supports the management and
the use of SPDK.

### Design workflow

* Modify the rpc.py provided by SPDK, and use init() to encapsulate most of its
original functions, and then execute rpc.py when itâ€™s invoked by pyspdk.py.
* When the upper management application needs to get something about SPDK, it
will call pyspdk.py. And then the pyspdk.py can tell if the process of SPDK is
alive in system. If not, it will initialize and start the server.
* The pyspdk.py uses the rpc.py to communicate with the SPDK server
application, as: nvmf_tgt, vhost, etc, and then to get something about SPDK,
as: get_luns, get_interfaces, get_vhost_blk_controller, etc.
