      "message": "Rather than changing the public API function, can we just move the declaration of g_spdk_nvmf_tgt_conf to nvmf_internal.h. That way we avoid breaking other people\u0027s implementations if they happen to be using something other than the stock target application.\n\nIf there is a strong reason that it needs to be this way, and we end up deciding to change the public API then there will definitely need to be a changelog entry.",
