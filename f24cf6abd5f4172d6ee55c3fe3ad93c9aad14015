      "message": "I think here if you have the unload cb_fn and cb_arg saved in bs-\u003edev, you could copy them to local variables, call bs-\u003edev-\u003edestroy() and then at the end do the callback but with the local variables instead of referencing bs-\u003edev.\n\nOr alternatively, stuff an spdk_bs_dev structure itself into spdk_blob_store, and copy the contents during init/load (instead of saving the pointer).  I think that makes your life easier here, plus users don\u0027t have to remember to free the spdk_bs_dev structure in their destroy() callback.",

      "message": "We can\u0027t move this outside of the lock.  _spdk_io_device_attempt_free() walks the device list so has to hold the lock.\n\nWe can put a lock/unlock pair in _spdk_io_device_attempt_free(), but can you first explain the problem that precipitated moving this?",
