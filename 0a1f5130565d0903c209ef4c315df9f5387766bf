      "message": "This is technically breaking an API - there could be scripts out there that depend on the old names. I very much doubt that there is, since CHAP didn\u0027t work before this patch series. How do you all feel about that? Should we make this report both the old and new names for a release or two, or is this a place where backward compatibility likely doesn\u0027t matter.",
