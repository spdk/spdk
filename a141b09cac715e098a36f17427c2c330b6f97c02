      "message": "Per-file install targets have a wildcard in name ($(DESTDIR)$(includedir)%.h), while this is a plain list of files. Please be consistent and refactor this to use wildcards as well.\n\nMy other concern is that install targets have the full path in their name (/usr/include/myfile.h), while uninstall targets are just filenames (myfile.h). This looks like a hack. I\u0027m not sure actually - what\u0027s the common practice for implementing uninstall targets? Another option is to use a single per-file target for install/uninstall and check the cmd-line-specified target name to decide whether the file should be installed or uninstalled.\n\n```\n$(DESTDIR)$(includedir)%.h:\n\tifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),install)\n\t\t$(INSTALL_HEADER)\n\telse\n\t\t$(UNINSTALL_HEADER)\n\tfi\n```",
