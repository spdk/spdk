      "message": "I just talked with Ben.  Since nvme_ctrlr_set_host_id() has special cases, you must do a separate function, and then you must set state to WAIT_FOR_SET_HOST_ID in that function.\n\nI am concerned that inline this function here makes this code appear different.  It is not really different, but I think it might be more clear and consistent if we do make this a separate function.  Then these functions are always responsible for setting the WAIT_FOR_XXX state.\n\nSorry - I know we are going back and forth on this.  I think in the end the code will be clearer this way and that wasn\u0027t obviously until seeing your other patches.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
