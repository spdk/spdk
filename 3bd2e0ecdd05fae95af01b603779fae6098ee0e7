      "message": "this is kind of a nit - but putting the NOTICELOG here changes behavior slightly - before, we would only print this when we listen on the port for the first time - any subsequent listens wouldn\u0027t get this NOTICELOG\n\nso I think you should just move this before the \"success\" label\n\nsame for TCP below\n\n(If there\u0027s a good reason to change it, I\u0027m fine with that, but it should be a separate patch.)",

      "message": "true, move it under success label because in tcp there was debug log meaning almost the same as that notice\n\nis there any value to keep that debug log? if so i would move notice above success and restore debug log + do the same for rdma for consistency\n\nhowever I\u0027m also fine with your suggestion,\n\nBen - what you think?",
