      "message": "I\u0027ll be happy to change the permissions to 755 (from 644) when doing the install.   Looking at a running system, I can see examples of both types of permissions:   some libs have 755 while others have 644.   I don\u0027t think execute is required, but given that the majority of libs I\u0027ve seen on a system have them set, perhaps we should follow suit.",
