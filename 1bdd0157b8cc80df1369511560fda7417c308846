On the other hand we sometimes do the similar for other tools and it doesn\u0027t really hurt to have a couple of additional lines.\n\nI\u0027m ok with having this in README, but I think that the section in which this is added (Linux setup) is not accurate. Perhaps we could move this somewhere to bottom of the file as an appendix?",
