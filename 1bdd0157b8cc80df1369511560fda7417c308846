      "message": "I have mixed feelings about this.\n\nI don\u0027t think that this README file is a good place to document same things which are already present in VBox User manual. On the other hand we sometimes do the similar for other tools and it doesn\u0027t really hurt to have a couple of additional lines.\n\nI\u0027m ok with having this in README, but I think that the section in which this is added (Linux setup) is not accurate. Perhaps we could move this somewhere to bottom of the file as an appendix?",

      "message": "Vbox is not stable, it leads to failed in some cases. the main commands are in https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.0/UserManual.pdf\nand I also notices that \"if you create a VM by scripts\", all creations are done by the scripts.\n\nExtra commands which I mentioned as below is to help to clear a broken VM environment. \nA guide is also a document that can help to improve to use the Vbox ,I think this\u0027s useful .\n\nVagrant commands are not must. I know that libvirt need more other commands , I also tried libvirt,such as vagrant plugin install vagrant libvirt.yum install libvirt. you also can help to add this like vm_setup installing packages . \n\nWe need a beginning about thisï¼Œ or can you give a template.\nAnd I think this is a branch which is creates by manual or scripts.",
