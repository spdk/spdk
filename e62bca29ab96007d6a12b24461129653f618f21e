I\u0027m concerned that this could have garbage in it that we interpret as an error when the compare operation completes\n\nmaybe we should keep another bool in the nvme_bdev_io for first_fused_completed?  then you can use that to know whether the bio-\u003ecpl is valid (i.e. if this gets called and first_fused_completed \u003d\u003d true, then you know this is the completion for the write)",
