      "message": "I think the callers to this function need to be examined too.  But arguably that could/should be done in a separate patch.\n\nThe first caller (spdk_iscsi_handle_r2t_snack) doesn\u0027t even do anything except print an error message if this function returns !\u003d 0.\n\nThe second caller (spdk_iscsi_op_data) tries to reject the PDU is this function returns !\u003d 0.  Presumably the reject will fail too and will treat it as a fatal connection error so it *probably* does the right thing.\n\nBut I think this patch is fine for now - it certainly is no worse than before!  But we certainly need to look through some of these error paths in some more detail.\n\n-Jim",
