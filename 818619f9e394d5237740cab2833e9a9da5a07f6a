      "message": "Hi Karol,\n\nI like removing duplicated functionality!  One question I have here - do we actually use this Device path output anywhere in the nvmf version?  I\u0027m just wondering if we need to add these prints here.  We already print something similar on lines 68-69 - I\u0027m guessing we can remove one of them.\n\n-Jim",

      "message": "Yeah, I guess you\u0027re right. I just added this print because someone before had this \"Found devices\" on line 68.\nBut now looking at the logs I see that the first print shows \"sda, sdb\" and the second \"/dev/sda,/dev/sdb\". I think second print Device paths is better so I\u0027ll leave this one.\n\nAs for the use of \"device_paths\" - Its used for both nvmf and iscsi on line 86 in fio.communicate().",

      "message": "This seems to be inconsistent with the change to the verify flag above.  In that case, you removed the \u0027else\u0027 and just set verify \u003d False before the if statement.  But here you remove the norandommap \u003d 0 assignment before the if statement, and put it in the else instead.\n\nIn general, unless either of these changes are really needed, I\u0027d just remove these changes completely.  It\u0027s not really clear why these changes are important to bring nvmf functionality into this script.",
