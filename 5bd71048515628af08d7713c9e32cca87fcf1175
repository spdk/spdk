      "message": "this basically duplicates the existing union spdk_nvme_feat_arbitration\n\nhow about instead we just include a union spdk_nvme_feat_arbitration here?  i know it means a union within a union, and you\u0027d need to access members by something like cdw11.feat_arbitration.bits.ab, but we\u0027d get rid of a lot of duplication here and avoid inconsistency if we add definitions for other features\u0027 bits in the future",
