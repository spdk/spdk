      "message": "This is very RDMA specific. I don\u0027t think this will do anything for TCP and it doesn\u0027t do anything for PCIe. Therefore, I think we should try to hide this instead of making it public.\n\nWhat if we always use non-blocking mode and then automatically check for RDMA CM events whenever the user polls the admin queue for completions?",

      "message": "ibv_get_async_event delivers events for device\u0027s context. So nvme_rdma_event_handler can fetch events not-related to the specific qpair.

It\u0027s not clear for me, how user will deliver or handle such events.\n\nIB async event don\u0027t have any tome notion for events. How event handler will differentiate relevant and non-relevant events (old event\u0027s for example)?",
