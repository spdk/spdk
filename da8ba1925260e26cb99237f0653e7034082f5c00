Is there any way we can keep the params, but show them as non-optional in help?",

Since they are still part of the non-positional arguments, they will still be listed under the confusing header “optional arguments” even if they are required.\n\nFurthermore, from argparse doc:\n\n\u003e  Required options are generally considered bad form because users expect options to be optional, and thus they should be avoided when possible.",
