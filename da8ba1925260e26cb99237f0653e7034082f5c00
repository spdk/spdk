      "message": "I think single-char options still added some value by separating those arguments.\n\ne.g. I have no idea what `0123456789123456` means, but with `--encrypt-key 0123456789123456` it would be significantly easier to read. `-k 0123456789123456` as it is now is something inbetween and it\u0027s... tolerable. Is there any way we can keep the params, but show them as non-optional in help?",
