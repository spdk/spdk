      "message": "Following from earlier comments:\n\nBut there are a bunch of next_func functions that all do things like cli_context-\u003ebs \u003d bs, and set page_size, channel, etc. separately.  All of these next_func functions have to go through load_bs first I think.  So you can just set a bunch of these fields in load_bs and not have to do it separately in several different next_func functions.",
