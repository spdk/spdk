      "message": "I\u0027ll just comment on example of this change, so not to generate too much comments.\n\nThere\u0027s an IF statement in migration_tc2_cleanup_nvmf_tgt function. If first param is proveided then we send SIGKILL. If not we send SIGTERM. (I imagine the original author of the script wanted to do a \"clean exit\" and use SIGKILL as last resort).\n\nCalling migration_tc2_cleanup_nvmf_tgt without any arguments is on purpose here - we want to use SIGTERM.\nLine 41 has an example where we explicitly call it with SIGKILL.\n\nSince migration tests are chained (migration.sh is called with params, then sources and calls migration_tc2() and so on) at this point it\u0027s pretty hard to say what\u0027s inside \"$@\" so we risk IF in migration_tc2_cleanup_nvmf_tgt enetering just one branch.\n\n\nAlso, my personal opinion: I don\u0027t really see a benefit of passing all of parent scope params to functions local scope.\nIMO 2119 and 2120 should stay excluded.",
