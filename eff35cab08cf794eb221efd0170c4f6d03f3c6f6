I think we should add a bit of text on a couple of characteristics of the RAID bdev module:\n\n1) clarify that this RAID functionality does not store on-disk metadata on the member disks; so user must reconstruct the RAID volume when restarting the application\n2) clarify that it is OK to specify member disks that do no exist yet; as the member disks are registered, the RAID module will claim them, and will surface the RAID volume after all of the member disks are available",
