      "message": "moving the loop-related code into this file makes sense - I\u0027m just wondering if we need to put it directly into this function?  or can we do:\n\n1) make spdk_iscsi_read_pdu private to this file (named iscsi_read_pdu?)\n2) add spdk_iscsi_handle_incoming_pdus here which calls iscsi_read_pdu in a loop\n\n#2 would look similar then to the iscsi_conn_handle_incoming_pdus that was in conn.c\n\nI guess I like this function just handling at most one PDU, and the loop stuff handled elsewhere.  It avoids having to make sure we also return pdu_recv_loop_cnt.",
