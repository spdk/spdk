      "message": "I feel like this might confuse people.  The stats test here is fine - I\u0027m just looking back at how these stats are counted.\n\nI think people will expect this to be the *current* number of admin or io qpairs - not the number of admin or io qpairs that have been created since the target started.  I think this patch is fine for now (it\u0027s testing the current implementation) but I feel like we should either change how these are counted, or add additional stats like \"current_admin_qpairs\" and \"current_io_qpairs\".",
