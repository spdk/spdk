      "message": "this can return 1\n\nthese return values are not well documented currently - any poller function should return 0 if it did no real work, \u003e\u003d 1 if it did some real work, or -1 if it is not known currently\n\nwe use these to determine TSC stats per reactor - there is work in progress to get data to see if the pollers are doing real work or mostly idle - when we started on it, we changed all pollers to return -1, and then fix them to return a more meaningful value as we had time to do so",

      "message": "should we have any kind of timeout?\n\ni am concerned that a buggy bdev may successfully return GOOD status, but some I/O are still outstanding - in this case, the reset task would never complete\n\nif you think that is the correct behavior, I am OK with it - just want to make sure",
