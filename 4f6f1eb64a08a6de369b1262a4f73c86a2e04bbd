      "message": "Haha Ben said the opposite a couple of patch sets ago. He said the for loop made it more obvious that I was filling out an SGL one entry at a time. I think that the semantic change of referencing the SGEs in terms of the SGL accomplishes that. I think I will change it back to the do while loop I had originally. That felt the most natural to me.",
