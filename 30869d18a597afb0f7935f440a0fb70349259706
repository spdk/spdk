      "message": "I agree with Alexey\u0027s comment on previous version of this patch.  I think a better renaming strategy would be to change _bdev_nvme_reset_done to _bdev_nvme_reset_create_qpairs_done (and do that in a separate patch before this one).  That reduces the confusion on what is really \"done\" when _bdev_nvme_reset_done is called.\n\n(After looking at later patches, I think _bdev_nvme_reset_complete is the best name for this function, even though here in this patch, it\u0027s only checking a result).",
