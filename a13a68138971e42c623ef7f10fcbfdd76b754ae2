But if we don\u0027t check failed_state here, rc \u003c 0 should still get us to do what is needed.\n\nMaybe I\u0027m missing a race condition here.

      "message": "I\u0027m not following the || true \u0026 at the end of this.  Does the || true really do anything?  I think running fio_nvme in the background means that even if it eventually exits with failure, it doesn\u0027t result in this script exiting with failure.  I\u0027m also thinking that calling fio_nvme as a function, having the || true, and then the \u0026 at the end will probably confuse others too.  I just tested on my system, and sleep 5 || true \u0026 operates completely different between zsh and bash.  With zsh, sleep 5 runs in the foreground for 5 seconds, then true runs in the background which of course exits immediately.  For bash, all of (sleep 5 || true) runs in the background.\n\nBut then there\u0027s no || true below at line 46.  So maybe I\u0027m not understanding why it was put here.",
