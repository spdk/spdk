      "message": "I\u0027d like Changpeng to look at this patch.  I\u0027m concerned that we will be increasing this to 2 seconds in the next patch, and now do it on uio_pci_generic too.  A lot of users will be affected - especially ones with many SSDs.\n\nChangpeng - could we move everything from here to end of this function to a new state in the controller state machine?  Then we can add this sleep as another state.  Then if we have 24 SSDs, instead of a 2 second sleep * 24 SSDs, the 2 second delays are incurred in parallel.",
