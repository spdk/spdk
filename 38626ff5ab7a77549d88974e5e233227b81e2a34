SNIA has a performance spec test spec for SSDs (http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SSS_PTS_Enterprise_v1.1.pdf). The spec defines three steps for pre-conditioning SSDs to achieve accurate, repeatable and reliable results:\n1) Purge the SSD to bring it to a consistent state.\n2) Workload Independent Preconditioning using 128K sequential writes to fill the device twice. This maps all LBA addresses and over-provisioning areas and fills them with data.\n3) Workload Dependent Preconditioning: Running the test workload to place the device into a steady state for the desired workload so that the average performance doesn\u0027t vary during the performance measurement window.\nTom\u0027s Hardware also has a great article that talks about SSD performance variability and how they get the performance to steady state that is locate at http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/enterprise-ssd-testing,2-863.html?_ga\u003d2.183777187.4055747.1515679441-984220001.1514927654",
