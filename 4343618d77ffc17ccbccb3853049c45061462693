      "message": "Why put the iov in the trace?  This is a local variable.  I don\u0027t think this will be helpful for root causing any issues.\n\nWe usually only want to record pointers which give us additional data about the tracepoint - for example, what connection this tracepoint is associated with (similar to the NVMf tracepoints).",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think EXECUTING adds much additional information.  We just posted an event in spdk_iscsi_read_pdu for TRACE_READ_PDU (now TRACE_ISCSI_READ_PDU).\n\nThere is always a tradeoff.  Adding extra trace points may add additional information, but when they are enabled, it adds extra overhead too.  The extra overhead can affect performance and reproducibility of bugs.  So we should be careful where we add additional tracepoints.",

It is meant to show how much data total was in the queue before we tried to flush data, then the next event shows how much it had afterwards.",
