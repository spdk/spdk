      "message": "This should be broken up into shorter lines.\n\nCan you also describe a bit what you might use this for, and what context you might call it from?\n\nOne problem I see is that if this gets called from the context of the poller function, it will all crash, since we remove the poller from the requisite TAILQ (see reactor.c:440 and reactor.c:456).\n\nWould the following changes work for you and Fujitsu?\n1) Change function to spdk_poller_set_period().\n2) spdk_poller_set_period() fails if you go from 0 to \u003e0, or vice versa.  Meaning you can only change a timer that already had a period \u003e 0 to a different period \u003e 0.\n3) if the period is changed, the new period does not take effect until after the current timer period expires.",
