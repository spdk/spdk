      "message": "Rather than converting int to bool here, it would probably be easier to just make the chap_disbled, etc. flags into Python boolean values in the argparse code.\n\nYou can achieve this using action\u003d\u0027store_true\u0027 in the parser setup code in scripts/rpc.py instead of type\u003dint.\n\nWe should probably also make this change for the header_digest and data_digest fields in the previous review.",
