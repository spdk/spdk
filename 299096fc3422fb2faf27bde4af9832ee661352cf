      "message": "We need to set both until strip_size is deprecated and I believe this is where to do it. the internal element strip_size is used throughout and later converted, the _kb one needs to be set before that conversion to LBA happens.  Am I missing something?",

      "message": "In the old code, strip_size gets set in KB here, and then later in raid_bdev_configure gets converted to blocks.  Therefore it must be that strip_size is not actually valid until after it gets converted in raid_bdev_configure.  But we had to set it here because we only had one field.\n\nSo based on that, I don\u0027t think you should set strip_size here.  We have two separate fields now, so I don\u0027t see why we need to set strip_size to an invalid value here and then be converted later.",
