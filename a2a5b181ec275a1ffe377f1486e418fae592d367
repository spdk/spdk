      "message": "Its not really right. This is due to status \u003d\u003d GOOD meaning two things in context of unmap (since there can be multiple ios sent):\n- all bdev io submitted so far were successful\n- status is unchanged\n\nThis would require change discussed previously. Since spdk_scsi_lun_execute_task() sets status \u003d GOOD, \n- spdk_scsi_lun_execute_task() default state should be 0xFF\n- spdk_bdev_scsi_task_complete_unmap_cmd() would set state according to first io returned\n- for subsequent io, check against status \u003d GOOD (as is now)\n\nShould I create that patch before this one ? Or is it fine to leave UT doing same thing that spdk_scsi_lun_execute_task() does at this time ?",
