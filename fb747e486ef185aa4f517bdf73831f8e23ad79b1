I\u0027m wondering if it really belongs outside of them though, further down, at the same level as BLOBFS, PMEM and LVOL?",

      "message": "I prefer just passing -l lvs0 instead of -u $lvs_u.  It avoids having to do the extra variables.  Then you can also avoid the lvb_u assignment, by using the alias for the lvol (lvs0/lvb0) instead of $lvb_u.\n\nBut now I\u0027m wondering what the compress volume would prepend COMP_ to?  Will it always use the name that\u0027s passed but the user?",
