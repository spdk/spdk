      "message": "I think this should be a different patch, and maybe controlled by a different flag.\n\nThe change below fixes a bug - when user specifies more cores than there are bdevs.  That belongs in this patch.\n\nBut this part here also changes behavior when only one bdev is specified.  Imagine two cases:\n\n1) conf file describes only 1 bdev, and -T is not used\n2) conf file describes only 1 bdev, and -T is used\n\nI think the behavior should be the same for both.  But with this patch, #2 will execute that bdev on all cores, while #1 will not.\n\nMaybe a new flag can be added to run the specified bdev on all cores, but that should be a separate patch.",
