      "message": "should we allow unmap on a zoned device?\n\nI don\u0027t think in general this is very useful.  If UNMAP does not describe an entire zone, then it will always fail - and what should user do in that case?\n\nI think it\u0027s OK to just not support UNMAP here, but would like to hear your input.\n\n(Marking -1 for now while we work through this question.  The code itself looks fine if we decide to keep UNMAP here.)",
