      "message": "Is spdk_app_start_application guaranteed to get executed on the g_init_lcore?\n\nMaybe it doesn\u0027t matter - but before we always made sure that the user\u0027s start function would get invoked on the same core as they called spdk_app_start.  I personally feel like we should still make sure there\u0027s that guarantee.\n\nMaybe for now just add an assert that spdk_env_get_current_core() \u003d\u003d g_init_lcore here.  Even if this all moves to threads, I feel like this \"master\" thread shouldn\u0027t have a chance to move before we\u0027ve started the application.",
