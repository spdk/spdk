      "message": "Or wrote: as I wrote in the change-log, the only kernel version (5.0.x) that doesn\u0027t supports this is EOL-ed by now (see kernel.org main page). I don\u0027t see the point to export config option now for supporting old kernel. We can keep it in the code for some time under ifdef and then remove the ifdef as well. The kernel target has none of them (config option nor ifdef), we shouldn\u0027t be holier than the pope here IMHO.",

      "message": "Ziye said: Change log is not ok. For us, we still have some kernels between 5.0 and 5.1. And if other customers use the old version or back porting the module without the optimized support, it will fail. I do not object setting the default value to 1, but if you do not export the config, customers need to change the spdk code to compile or change the kernel code in the initiator side, and it is not flexible.",

      "message": "the old kernel is EOL, practically due to the nature of the kernel, it\u0027s impossible can set a production system that uses an ELOed kernel -- this is exactly why everyone @ China or elsewhere that I know use one of the LTS kernels listed at kernel.org: 4.4, 4.9, 4.14 or 4.19 \n\nIf someone uses EOLed or backported kernel, they should either rebuild spdk or backport the optimization. This is how I see it.\n\nLets have one of the maintainers to provide their vote..",
