Just to make it clear that this will be a 2MB aligned address.\n\nThat would be inline with how spdk_mem_map_clear_translation is called below.  We could also just get rid of the local vaddr variable that shadows the vaddr function parameter as well (which would require using a shifted vfn_2mb in a couple of other places above).",
