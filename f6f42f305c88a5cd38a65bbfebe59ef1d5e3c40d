      "message": "Hi Wojciech,\n\nThere are parts of this patch that aren\u0027t really related to retry.  I\u0027d really like to see these broken out into a separate patch.  It helps make the patches smaller and keeps each patch focused on one \"thing\".  All of this makes it easier for others to review, plus smaller patches get quicker attention from someone like me who may be looking for small patches to review when I have just a few minutes between meetings.\n\nIt\u0027s really a good practice to think about in general - not just this patch.\n\n-Jim",

      "message": "I\u0027d really like this change, as well as the for \u003d\u003e while loop change below and anything related to updating io-\u003epos broken out into a separate patch.  Having that in a separate patch with a clear commit message describing the change will make it easier for others to review.  It looks like it isn\u0027t specific to this retry functionality either - or at least some of it can be prepared in one patch, and then this patch can make modifications to it if necessary.",
