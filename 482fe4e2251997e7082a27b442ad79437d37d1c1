      "message": "We need to make sure the spdk_put_io_channel() caller is synchronized with the I/O path.  It shouldn\u0027t be possible to get here while simultaneously destroying a poll group on a different thread.  If that is still possible, this fix will just reduce the potential window for a race, not remove it.\n\nIt seems like the poll group destroy path should probably send a message to each thread to destroy its own io_channel and wait for them to complete before freeing the poll group.",
