      "message": "This GUID info is for devices that were taken over by lvol_store, such as NVMe or Malloc. Driver_specific (dump_config_json) is used by lvol to display its own details (currently its base_bdev name of lvol_store). I see two ways to get lvol_store GUID on get_bdevs() RPC call:\n1) Add lvol-specific information to generic bdev API as implemented right now in this patch\n2) Remove bdev that was taken over by lvol_store and replace it with new lvol_store bdev. That might add too much complexity\nAnother solution would be to drop changes in get_bdevs() and implement another RPC call to display lvol_stores only - get_lvol_stores().",
