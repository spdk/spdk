      "message": "After seeing your patch, I think we need to make some additional modifications.\n\nThe spdk_subsystem init functions should return void now.  They should pass their return code as a parameter to spdk_subsystem_init_next() instead.  So spdk_subsystem_init_next() should return void as well, but take an int parameter.\n\nThe rest of the patch looks pretty good.",
