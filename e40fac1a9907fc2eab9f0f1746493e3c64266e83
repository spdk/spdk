      "message": "After seeing your patch, I think we need to make some additional modifications.\n\nThe spdk_subsystem init functions should return void now.  They should pass their return code as a parameter to spdk_subsystem_init_next() instead.  So spdk_subsystem_init_next() should return void as well, but take an int parameter.\n\nThe rest of the patch looks pretty good.",

      "message": "I think we need to change where spdk_subsystem_init() is called.  Right now it is called at the end of spdk_app_init().  There is some code (for example, bdevperf) that expects the subsystems and bdevs to be initialized once spdk_app_init() returns.\n\nSo I think we should modify your patch here to call spdk_subsystem_init() in spdk_app_start() instead of spdk_app_init().  You will also need to create a patch to modify bdevperf to call bdevperf_construct_targets() from bdevperf_run instead of main(), so that we guarantee it is called after all subsystems and bdevs have been initialized.\n\nWe may also want to consider removing spdk_app_init() completely, and merge its functionality with spdk_app_start().  But we can look at that later.",
