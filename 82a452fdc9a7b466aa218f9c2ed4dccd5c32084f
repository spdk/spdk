      "message": "This is probably ok - but it means we\u0027re referencing another cache line per controller in the hot I/O path - I\u0027m concerned this could impact 10M+ IOPs tests.\n\nIs this the best place to demonstrate how this works?  I\u0027m wondering if the test/nvme/reset app would be a better place to demonstrate it.  I just don\u0027t want nvme/perf to become the place where we demonstrate how to use the SPDK NVMe driver - too many bells and whistles and it could impact overall efficiency.",
