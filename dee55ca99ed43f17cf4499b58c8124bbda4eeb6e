      "message": "Hi, Shuhei\nIf my understand is correct, the meaning of parsed_bytes and ext_data_bytes is following:\n1. Buffer between 0 ~ (parsed_bytes-1) is DIFed\n2. Buffer between parsed_bytes ~ (ext_data_bytes -1) is data without DIF, and these data are compacted.\nSo I think ext_data_bytes in _are_iovs_valid() is not enough, since ext_data_bytes doesn\u0027t contain space for metadata.",
