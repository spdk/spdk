      "message": "how about \"set_iscsi_discovery_auth\"?\n\nunfortunately we did not add \"iscsi\" (or \"nvmf\") to a lot of RPCs, but I think including iscsi in the name here makes it more clear and helps in case we have similar RPC for NVMe-oF in the future\n\nThis name is also more aligned to the C API - using the phrase \"discovery_auth\" instead of \"auth_for_discovery\"",
