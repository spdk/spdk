      "message": "Good question Paul.  They\u0027re not exactly the same - for most common cases, sector_size is 512 or 4096 and md_size is 0.  But Shuhei is doing all of the DIF/DIX work where CRCs are saved with the data - in this case, md_size \u003e 0.\n\nFurther down, he saves the \"extended_sector_size\" in entry-\u003eblock_size.  This is equivalent to the sector_size + md_size.  So using entry-\u003eblock_size across the board here makes the code a bit easier to read.",

      "message": "Thanks for good Question Paul, and thanks for clarification Jim.\n\nAs Jim says, I have used block_size to mean sector_size + md_size.\n\nCurrent struct spdk_bdev have blocklen and NVMe bdev module hold sector_size + md_size in it, so I have followed that. (Oh, it may be better to use blocklen as name, but I can do that change later.)\n\nNVMe Perf tool is for NVMe and so extended_sector_size \u003d sector_size + md_size may be better but I hope these differences are not critical for now.",
