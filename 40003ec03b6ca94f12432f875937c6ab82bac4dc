It\u0027s something we can improve later though.\n\nThere\u0027s a typo in the message - it should be libpmempool, not libmempool.\n\nAlso, the package is already in the 18.10 repositories - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/cosmic/+package/libpmempool-dev\n(cosmic \u003d 18.10)\nCould we try to `apt-get install libpmempool-dev` and exit with an error msg only if it failed? There\u0027s no need to make assumptions whether the package is available.",
