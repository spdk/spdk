      "message": "My assumption was that this value would be used for calculating cpu utilization. The model I had assumed was that a user would take one measurement at the beginning of a benchmark, and another at the end. In between the two measurements they would measure the time and compute the utilization using those values.\nThe reason I didn\u0027t keep track of accumulated elapsed time was I figured that it would tempt people to calculate disk utilization by taking io_time / accumulated_elapsed_time. I figured this would skew results towards 0 since it would keep track of long stretches when the bdev was up, but not actually performing any I/O.\nIs there a need to track long term (creation to deletion) cpu utilization? Or is there another way we would use the two values together?",
