I added removed in the previous patch and took your advice in it.\n\ntarget-\u003edestructed and (target-\u003edestruct_cb_fn !\u003d NULL) have the same meaning, but iscsi.c have referred the member of struct spdk_iscsi_tgt_node directly and (target-\u003edestruct_cb !\u003d NULL) is hard to understand in iscsi.c. So I want to add both destructed and destruct_cb_fn to struct spdk_iscsi_tgt_node.",
