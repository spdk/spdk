You could even change the \u0027range\u0027 var used in the first list check to ch_range or something and below compare range-\u003eoffset to ch_range_offset and range-\u003elength to ch_range-\u003elength which is obviously the same thing but maybe easier to see what\u0027s going on (if you think so too)",
