      "message": "Does DPDK skip mapping hugepages if --no-pci is passed? Maybe in a future patch we could track whether we\u0027re in no-pci mode and tell DPDK that we need only a very small number of hugepages to allocate rings and mempools, and then change the behavior of spdk_dma_malloc to just call regular malloc.\n\nActually, I think DPDK 17.05 added the ability to provide a custom memory allocator. We should look into that and if the user says --no-pci, we can do a custom allocator that just calls malloc and free.\n\nThis patch is fine for now - these are just ideas for the future.",
