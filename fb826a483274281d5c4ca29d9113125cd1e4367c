      "message": "This looks like it has the potential to be easily missed when considering thread safety concerns; could we make this a global variable instead for clarity? (I don\u0027t know what the current thread safety situation is for this function; are we always calling this under a mutex or on a particular thread to make this safe?)",

      "message": "It would probably be good to add a sanity check here for overflow.\n\nctrlr_num is an unsigned int, so if ctrlr_num \u003d\u003d UINT_MAX, we have run out of ids to assign. (This is 2^32 - 1 on normal architectures, so quite a lot, but potentially still reachable.)\n\nWe should at least return an error in this case, or maybe search for an unused id?",

(Does this function need to deal with i \u003c 0?)\n\nAlternatively, we could change the parameter to be unsigned to match the vdev-\u003eid type, but I don\u0027t know if that has other implications for the functions that use this one.",
