      "message": "There\u0027s no real reason for line 227, but this trace is bound to be called during the initialization of the IO, so it\u0027s guaranteed to be equal to ftl_io_get_lba(io, 0). But sure, I can replace it with ftl_io_get_lba(io, 0), just to underline that fact.\n\nAs for line 301, for requests that are completed from without sending anything to the SSD (i.e. cache hit, unwritten data read), it makes more sense to record the actual LBA that was completed rather than the first one.",
