      "message": "Yea, I think all requests need a bit of change from \"catch all\" type requests. This would be a good change in future to rethink those requests in whole lvol/vbdev_lvol.\n\nUnfortunately before this moment, it is not assured that sync (that saved this name to disk) succeeded. So it seems like the best place to change the lvol name.\n\nFor now adding new field with this new name might be the way to pass it here.",

      "message": "I think, for now, easiest would be adding field in spdk_lvol_req. Then after refactoring requests, it could be removed.\n\nWhy?\nAt first look, i thought easiest would be adding new spdk_blob_op_complete type ie spdk_blob_op_with_lvol_name_complete. But then i saw spdk_blob_sync_md(), which uses spdk_blob_op_complete is used in a few more places. Changing it like that required changes in places unrelated to lvol rename problem.",
