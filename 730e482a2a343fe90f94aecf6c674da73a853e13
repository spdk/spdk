      "message": "This is unfortunate.  But bdev layer currently doesn\u0027t have a helper function to get the channel from a bdev_io.  We should probably add something - similar to spdk_bdev_io_get_thread.  Then you would not need to save the channel like this.\n\nI\u0027m OK with this as it is now, but if you\u0027d like to add a small bdev patch to add spdk_bdev_io_get_channel before this one, then you could use it here (and you\u0027ll need to rebase this patch anyways).",
