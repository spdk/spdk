      "message": "Hi Gang,\n\nWhy do we need to do this check here?\n\nI think it is OK if we count one or two extra I/O.  If we are testing for 60 seconds, we probably have completed millions of I/O, so one or two extra do not make any real difference.\n\nI think this just makes the code more complicated.  It also adds more calls to spdk_get_ticks() which are not cheap.  So it could actually hurt performance in the case where we are trying to get 3-4 million I/O on one core.",
