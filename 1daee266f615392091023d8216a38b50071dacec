Two cases I may think of: the calling thread is incrementing it while the cb thread is decrementing it, and two cb thread may be decrementing it at the same time.\n\nIf there is a race condition, what is a common solution for it?\nI know SPDK prefers lockless I/O. So I am not sure if mutex or semaphore is a good idea or not.",
