      "message": "maybe init/fini instead of acquire/release?  I feel like acquire/release isn\u0027t semantically correct - especially if long term you remove the DEBUG code\n\nwhich does lead me to my next question - are you planning to keep this DEBUG code in long-term?  I\u0027m open to that if we think we need it, but it\u0027s a bit non-standard so might be good to mention that in the commit message - I\u0027m even wondering if it even needs to be under a DEBUG flag - do you think it\u0027s that much of a pessimization in release builds?",
