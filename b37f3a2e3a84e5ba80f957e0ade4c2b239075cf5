      "message": "Hi Stephen,\n\nI saw your reply on why we need to keep this special check here for pci addresses.  But I think the spdk_vtophys calculation at the very bottom of this file is expecting the phys addr to still be 2MB aligned - see how it does an | (or) instead of a +.\n\nSo probably this code is fine, but line 515 needs to be changed to addition instead of bitwise OR.\n\nAm I reading this correctly?\n\n-Jim",
