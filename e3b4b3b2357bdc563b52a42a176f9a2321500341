      "message": "I think using lsblk is more universal and you can just extend previous version of waitforblk by adding \"SERIAL\" option like this:\n\nlsblk -l -o NAME,SERIAL\n\nI guess this also makes easier to understand what $1 is exactly. For \"sudo nvme list\" you have to refer to man/help if you don\u0027t remember the output, while lsblk -l -o NAME,SERIAL is pretty clear in terms of what will be displayed.",

Also change the name to NVME_SERIAL - to be consistent with MALLOC_* variables and to show that it\u0027s a global var.\n\n\nBTW, it might be a good idea to try to move these 3 variables into test/nvmf/common.sh as part of some separate commit. They are repeated in multiple scripts and have the same values.",
