Or is that currently unspecified (\u003d some generic error response) and will be clarified together with the overall error handling cleanup?\n\nAccording to the code, it still returns \"invalid parameters\" as error in all cases. I think it is worthwhile to describe that explicitly here, then people reading the API documentation don\u0027t need to dig into the code to find that information.",
