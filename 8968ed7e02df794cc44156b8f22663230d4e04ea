      "message": "Since this function is very specific to this particular SCSI name string designator type, it is probably better to just add the new function as a private function in this file, rather than making it a public string API (I don\u0027t think it will be used elsewhere).\n\nIt also might be simpler to remove the printf-style format string, since we aren\u0027t really using it here - maybe it could work more like spdk_strcpy_pad().",
