The TAILQ_ENTRY base_bdevs[i]-\u003ebase_bdev_link is added to TAILQ_HEAD of vbdev-\u003ebase_bdevs. This fine if the base bdev is used only to construct one vbdev, but if the same base bdev is used to construct another vbdev the same TAILQ_ENTRY is added to another TAILQ_HEAD  overwriting previous one. You can\u0027t do that. To fix this base_bdev_link should be an array of TAILQ_ENTRY but this don\u0027t make sense so base_bdev_link is converted to array of pointers.",
