What meaning of the value will be, if divide it on number of its changes during the sample time? Maybe there should be sum of all values of spdk_mempool_count(\u003cpool\u003e), that were during the sample, divided on number of its changes?\nAlso if number of changes is zero, there will be divizion on zero.",

      "message": "The division doesn\u0027t make sense. I think you can just report the value of spdk_mempool_count every sample period in this poller. Then you don\u0027t need all these atomics throughout the code either. You could make this run more often too - possibly as frequently as every 1 or 10ms - to get more accurate samples.",
