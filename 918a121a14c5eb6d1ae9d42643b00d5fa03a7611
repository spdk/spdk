      "message": "Instead of modifying this function, how about we leave it as it was. The code below can send a message that calls a new function and that new function can simply do rqpair-\u003ecurrent_recv_depth \u003d rqpair-\u003emax_queue_depth and then call the old nvmf_rdma_destroy_drained_qpair function.\n\nThe advantage to this strategy is that it eliminates a flag from the rqpair, and we need to keep the size of those qpair objects down.",
