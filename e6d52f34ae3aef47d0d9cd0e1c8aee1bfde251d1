      "message": "I think the previous code should be kept.\n\nAll of the bdev modules should just set blockcnt directly - keeping the original code unchanged.  spdk_bdev_set_num_blocks() should only be used after a bdev has been registered and its size needs to be changed.\n\nspdk_bdev_set_num_blocks() assumes that the bdev has already been registered.  But spdk_bdev_register() is called after this point.  spdk_bdev_register() is what initializes the mutex, sets the initial status and initializes the open_descs TAILQ.",
