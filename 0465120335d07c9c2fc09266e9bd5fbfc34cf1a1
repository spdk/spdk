Considering this needs the test machines to be updated anyway, we would like to propose a slightly different solution.\n\nPlease see the patch here: https://review.gerrithub.io/c/spdk/spdk/+/442327\n\nI\u0027m sorry to push a different patch which deals with the same problem, but I found it much easier to just *do* the changes rather than explain them here.",
