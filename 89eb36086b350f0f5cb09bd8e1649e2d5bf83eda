      "message": "I agree that precise events make life easier for application. But what if multiple properties of block device change simultaneously. We will have to generate several precise events. This will force NVMf target to send multiple NS_ATTR_CHANGED async events to initiator and initiator will have to re-identify namespace multiple times.\nThis may be not a real world example at the moment. But I\u0027d like to know your thoughts about it.",

      "message": "You bring up a good point, but I still think precise events is better.\n\nFor example, we have a use case coming up around zones, where a zoned block device may need to tell the upper layer about a status update on a zone.  Handling of this type of async event will be completely different than a resize.  Short-term, exporting zoned bdevs over NVMe-oF isn\u0027t a strong use case - but if it was in the future, these types of events would be reported to the initiator with a different AER type (since the change is not part of namespace identify - it\u0027s a different log page).\n\nIf we do find multiple properties that could change, and be reported via NS_ATTR_CHANGED, that could result in multiple AERs.  But that should be very rare.  We may even be able to build some kind of coalescing into the NVMe-oF target - for example, after resuming the subsystem, don\u0027t complete the AER immediately, but wait some amount of time (1ms?) to allow multiple changes to coalesce.\n\nI also think it is cleaner to be precise, so that in the future, if we have 10 different types of changes that can happen on a bdev, the application can now exactly what parameter changed by looking at the event type.  If it\u0027s too general, then the application is forced to check 10 different things to figure out what changed.",

      "message": "I think there are some tricky races here.  desc-\u003eclosed is currently only touched by the thread the opens the descriptor.

I think by adding the lock+refs you can eliminate the current remove_scheduled member as well.\n\nTake a look and let me know on Slack if you have any questions or additional thoughts.",

      "message": "Yes - you\u0027re right on the descriptor getting removed - so this case shouldn\u0027t happen.  And reading this more for the closed flag and races between the two threads, I think that\u0027s OK also, since:\n\n1) spdk_bdev_close and spdk_bdev_notify_blockcnt_change acquire the bdev mutex before changing/checking the closed flag\n2) _update_notify doesn\u0027t acquire the bdev lock, but it always runs on the same thread as spdk_bdev_close so there\u0027s no possibility for race there either\n\nIt\u0027s still pretty messy though, and if the two of us have spent this much time discussing it, it will look suspect a few months from now if we have any problems in this area.\n\nI\u0027ll be curious to see if you\u0027re able to help readability with a per-descriptor lock.",
