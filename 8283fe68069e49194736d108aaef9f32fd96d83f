      "message": "I really don\u0027t like this. If any of those commands fails, you\u0027re so much screwed. It was OK to group rpc commands for creating nvmf subsystems in a tight loop, but this is too much.\n\nIf rpc.py is too slow for us, we should make it faster. Rewrite it to C if we must. But do not make our scripts impossible to debug. Right now we might just as well remove backtrace from autotest because for this entire test script it will be just useless.\n\nDebugging those test scripts is a pain already, let\u0027s not make it any harder.",
