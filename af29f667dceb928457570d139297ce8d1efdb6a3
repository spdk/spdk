Returning pointer or reference to mutable field might be considered as an error.\n\nAnyway, we are not in C++, so rely on const object that is changing it\u0027s internal representation (string content here) is quite undefined if someone cache the pointer.\n\nI think that declaration might be changed to \nconst char *spdk_cpuset_fmt(struct spdk_cpuset *set);\n\nWith additional info in documentation that it is unsafe to cache returned pointer as its memory might change if cpumask will be changed.",
