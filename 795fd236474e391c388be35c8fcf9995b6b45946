      "message": "Thank you for critical review, Jim. Yes, g_config_level_create is cleared to 0 in set_globals(). So this line is duplicated. And it was difficult to know how large granularity of each global parameter is. So I added clearing g_config_level_create to set_construct_req() to use g_config_level_create with more finer granularity. We will be able to refactor more but I hope this change will be better than nothing.",
