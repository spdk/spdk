      "message": "I think with this change, we will just end up with same problem when user tries to do large I/O which requires splitting.\n\nI think the better fix is to use the original formula (using +2) as the io_queue_requests to use for this namespace.  Then pass an spdk_nvme_io_queue_opts with this value when allocating the IO queue pair.  That will ensure that we at least have enough nvme_requests for everything, even if the underlying IO queue pair in hardware cannot support it.\n\nThen here, never fail by returning early and skipping this namespace, but still print a warning message.",
