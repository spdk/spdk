      "message": "I did this so that the whole xform is kept with the vbdev because of the key,  however I already have the key in here so yeh I guess this could be a local and I could copy the key into xform before ding the session_init.  I assume that xform data is copied from the address of the xform so we don\u0027t need to worry about it (the address) being referenced later?\n\nWith 2 +2\u0027s already my vote would be to merge and test with this and I can always pull the xform out of the vbdev later, its not a big thing.\n\nThanks for reviewing!!!!",
