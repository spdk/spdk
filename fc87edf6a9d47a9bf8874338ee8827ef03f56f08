      "message": "Thanks Shuhei, I was thinking that because the queuing is in the bdev layer that from a UT perspective on this function that it was sufficient to make sure that a mem error results in success which means it got queued.  I looked at the bdev internal list that I could check but that\u0027s bdev internals and not in the scope of UT this file. What do you think?",
