      "message": "Thanks Shuhei, I was thinking that because the queuing is in the bdev layer that from a UT perspective on this function that it was sufficient to make sure that a mem error results in success which means it got queued.  I looked at the bdev internal list that I could check but that\u0027s bdev internals and not in the scope of UT this file. What do you think?",

      "message": "Thank you Paul.\n\nI read the patch more than yesterday. _crypto_operation will return two error cases, ENOMEM and EINVAL. EINVAL is already covered at the line 409 and ENOMEM is covered here. We can mock spdk_bdev_queue_io_wait but it will not be necessary. As you say, simulating queueing is not in the scope of this UT.",
