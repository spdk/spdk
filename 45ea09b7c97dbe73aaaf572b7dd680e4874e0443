      "message": "-1 means \"no rate limit\". As these parameters are optional so that the default value is 0. In this case, if user does not explicitly set the related rate limit (we will have total 6 rate limits), it could be implicitly to disable the related rate limit if setting 0 as the \"no rate limit\". Looks like it is somewhat not that simple. Set \"-1\" as the \"no rate limit\" is to differentiate the default value of 0 and no rate limit of 0.",

      "message": "After reconsideration of this, I\u0027ve slightly change the parameter type to string so that it can tell 0 and the optional usage. For 0, it\u0027s also a valid string and for optional, it is NULL if not explicitly set. In this way, it can avoid the confusion to use -1 or use 0 as the disable operation. We can consistently use 0 for the disable.\n\nThanks for the comments. Thanks.",
