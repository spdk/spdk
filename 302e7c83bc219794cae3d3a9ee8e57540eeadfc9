      "message": "If I\u0027m understanding this correctly, there can be multiple crypto devices of each type, each of which may support multiple queue pairs. It\u0027s basically like NVMe devices in that sense. However, since the crypto operations are generally stateless, the user doesn\u0027t really care which crypto device they use, so you just multiply the number of devices times the queues per device to get a total number.\n\nFor the software devices, how are they exposed here? Is there one device with lots of queue pairs? Many devices each with one queue pair?\n\nFor QAT I assume there are 8-16 devices each with 1 queue pair. Is that right?\n\nThere is NUMA locality to consider, but I think we can ignore that for this first round.",

I think running the following test is going to make some things much more apparent:\n\nRun the bdev fio plugin with cpumask set to include lots of cores and at least 1 job per core. Each job should be doing random writes (rw\u003drandwrite) with data verification (verify\u003d1) enabled at high queue depth (iodepth\u003d256). Run this for an hour maybe.\n\nIf that passes, then I need to spend more time looking at what this is doing. I asked a question above about how the software crypto is exposed (multiple devices or one device) that would clear some things up for me too.",

      "message": "In here, you\u0027re adding this new library from the Intel IPsec submodule to the DPDK_LIB var, thus conflating the use of DPDK_LIB.   Previously, DPDK_LIB was limited to only objects from the DPDK submodule.   In spite of the existing complexity, I\u0027d propose you extend this mk file further so as to avoid the inclusion of the Intel library in DPDK_LIB.  This would mean adding some new vars like IPSEC_ABS_DIR, IPSEC_LIB_LIST and IPSEC_LIB, and then rolling them into the ENV_LINKER_ARGS which undoubtedly will result in some trial and error to get right, esp. if you run into any circular dependencies, but it would preserve (IMHO) the original, semantic meaning behind DPDK_LIB.",
