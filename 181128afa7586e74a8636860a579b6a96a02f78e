      "message": "if we have 8 compressed bdevs, we won\u0027t need to funnel I/O for all 8 to the same thread - we just need to funnel all I/O for any one compressed bdev to the same thread\n\nthis is really important for the ISAL case - we don\u0027t want to get completely bottlenecked on just one core\n\nI\u0027m ok with doing this for now to keep the initial patch simpler, but we\u0027ll need to rethink later.",

      "message": "this won\u0027t work like this - comp_ch is the ctx_buf, so this can get freed later if the channels are deleted out of order - for example:\n\nthread 0: create ch_count \u003d\u003d 1 (ch0 becomes the reduce-\u003ech)\nthread 1: create ch_count \u003d\u003d 2\nthread 0: delete ch_count \u003d\u003d 1 (but ch0 is still the reduce-\u003ech)\n\nnow I/O on thread 1 will not work\n\nNote in the bdev/iscsi driver, it only saves off the thread and creates the poller.\n\nI think you need to move the base_ch and the pending_comp_ios into the comp_bdev itself.  It\u0027s only the reduce_thread that will be accessing these (I think).  So they don\u0027t need to be per-channel.",

      "message": "I guess I\u0027m thinking that the PMD doesn\u0027t get persisted.  The compression algorithm needs to, but not the PMD that will perform the compression.\n\nWe should probably discuss this over IRC.  I\u0027d like to get others opinions.  I\u0027m not 100% set on dynamically choosing the PMD but that\u0027s where I\u0027m leaning.  It fits with copy_engine, where we\u0027ll use a DMA Offload engine if available, otherwise use a CPU memcpy.  The caller doesn\u0027t specify which to use - copy_engine chooses for them.\n\nMaybe we provide application startup hooks to disable QAT even if it\u0027s available.  We have something similar for CB-DMA.  I think if you have QAT offload, you want to use it, unless it\u0027s for testing/benchmarking purposes.",
