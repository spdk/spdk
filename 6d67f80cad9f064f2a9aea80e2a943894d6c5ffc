      "message": "Looking at this again, we might need to rethink our strategy.  If we get a large Write Zeroes request, this could require allocating a huge array of iovec structures.  For example, a 2 TB Write Zeroes with 4 KB zero_buffer_size would require 4 GB for iov.\n\nI think we probably need to add some kind of upper limit with splitting at the bdev layer to avoid having to allocate that much space just for iovecs.",
