      "message": "I coded it as you suggested in my first version locally.\n\nBut then I figured that the caller already has a function to print the app-specific options - it\u0027s the \"usage\" parameter to spdk_app_parse_args.  So the caller can just call that function after calling spdk_app_usage().\n\nI\u0027m OK adding it back in if you think it\u0027s better.  Or I can clarify here in the comment how we intend it to work.",
