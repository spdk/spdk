I guess I\u0027m not sure what the path is to hit a problem here.\n\nI see in spdk_file_write(), that we also hold the lock across the send_request call.\n\nReally there should be no reason to hold the lock across the send_request call - that call is asynchronous so holding the lock should have no effect.  I think spdk_file_write() should probably be modified to operate more like this function (_file_sync).",
