      "message": "you should never have to add /usr/lib - this is part of the automatic search path for libraries\n\nbut this seems to be different than what test/blobfs/fuse application does - the fuse/Makefile doesn\u0027t check anything, it just automatically adds -L/usr/local/lib -lfuse3 to LIBS\n\nit would be good if this was consistent - I think now mkfs depends on fuse3 which it did not before - that\u0027s OK, but then I think we should consider only building the test/blobfs directory if fuse3 is available",

      "message": "At this point, fuse3 is not required by blobfs_bdev, so they should be removed here in this patch. It is really weird to let mkfs test app include libfuse3.\n\nI\u0027m going to add build system detection for fuse in next patch, like you recommended. Then this patch can be decoupled with the fuse detection.",
