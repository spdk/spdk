      "message": "I agree with that this function should fail is base_name is a existing bdev (or existing nvme controller) but I have some doubts how this patch works. I think that there is some pitfall in attach_cb that doesn\u0027t check if nvme controller with base_name exist thant checking base_name here. I think someone need to look this deeper where real issue is. I\u0027ll add to revie Ben to have him look at this.\n\nBTW: I see more places where the SPDK could benefit from global facility service that would guarantee and create unique bdev or base bdev name.",
