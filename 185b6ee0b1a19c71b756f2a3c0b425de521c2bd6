      "message": "So it looks like the above 3 LOC need to happen after the unregister of the md_target is complete? If so and there are no other callers of the new function(s) above then why not move the above 3 LOC to the callback, remove the \"cleaned\" flag and move the code in new free_attempt function into the new destroy function at the very end.  This would make all the code with dependencies run in the callback and simplify a bunch of stuff.\n\nI could me missing something of course, please feel free to educate me :)\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t see any test code with this?",
