Developers may consume this code using one of two strategies:\n\n1) Using the NVMe-oF target application as-is, and as necessary adding new features (and hopefully contributing code back to the main SPDK project!)\n\n2) Using the NVMe-oF library inside of their own application.\n\nThis guide is applicable to both strategies.",
