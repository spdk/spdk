      "message": "can we just have one function pointer called start_rw_request, rather than a separate one for read and write?  because raid_bdev_start_rw_request can already differentiate between a READ and WRITE IO\n\nI just think that simplifies the code here a bit, and reduces confusion on why we have two different function pointers that point to the same function (and why that function switches on the IO type)",

      "message": "Sure, I can do that but I\u0027d prefer not to. IMHO I thought this was clearer (one function per entry in the function table based on function) and allowed for more flexibility in the future. Let me know, thanks for reviewing!",
