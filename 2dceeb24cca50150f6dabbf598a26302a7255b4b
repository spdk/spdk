      "message": "can we just have one function pointer called start_rw_request, rather than a separate one for read and write?  because raid_bdev_start_rw_request can already differentiate between a READ and WRITE IO\n\nI just think that simplifies the code here a bit, and reduces confusion on why we have two different function pointers that point to the same function (and why that function switches on the IO type)",

      "message": "Sure, I can do that but I\u0027d prefer not to. IMHO I thought this was clearer (one function per entry in the function table based on function) and allowed for more flexibility in the future. Let me know, thanks for reviewing!",

      "message": "I think if we want it to be more flexible in the future, we can separate the single function pointer into two later.  As the code is currently written, we have one raid_bdev_start_rw_request function that handles both reads and writes.  I think we want to encourage implementing this as one function rather than separate read v. write, since there is so much common code.\n\nTo take this even further, if someone did decide to implement different start_request functions for both read and write, then you would also need separate waitq_io_process functions for read and write.",
