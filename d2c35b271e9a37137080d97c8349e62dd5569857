I couldn\u0027t find anything online. rdmamojo doesn\u0027t explicitly state that that\u0027s not the case, but it doesn\u0027t list it as a requirement for connecting qpairs.\nhttps://www.rdmamojo.com/2014/01/18/connecting-queue-pairs/\n\nI assumed that it wouldn\u0027t matter just like tcp/ip one side has one port, the other side has another port and they just communicate. You just have to establish the ports up front.\n\nOf course I\u0027ve never tried using a port other than 4420 on either side.",
