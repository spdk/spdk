      "message": "I see one issue here. Example scenario:\n1. We add range here to the locked ranges list\n2. It will stuck on pending list because we have overlapping range(s) locked/pending\n3. We create new channel\n4. The range is added to locked ranges despite overlapping range will be added on this list as well\n\nWe probably need two lists in bdev internal structure - locked and pending - and switch range from one list to another when it lands in locked channel list.",

      "message": "It\u0027s actually even worse and can happen without overlapping:\n\nThread B locks range X and puts in the global list.\nThread B starts a for_each_channel().\nThread A for_each_channel() executes.\nThread C creates a new channel.  It inherits range X into its initial list.\nThread B for_each_channel() executes.\nThread C for_each_channel() executes.  Range X gets added to the initial list again.\n\nBased on our conversation on previous patch, I think I\u0027m going to move the pending list to the bdev itself.  And then I need to compare the ranges (including the locked_ctx) in the for_each_channel() routine before adding it, to make sure it\u0027s not getting duplicated.",
