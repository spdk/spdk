      "message": "\"The idea behind...\" -\u003e This sentence, or one equivalent to it, should be in the Introduction section. I think it sets the stage nicely right up front.\n\nI\u0027m not sure saying \"just use the help\" is clear that you mean \"vagrant --help\". You do write out \"vagrant --help\" a bit below, but it isn\u0027t immediately obvious that\u0027s related to this paragraph. I suggest something like this:\n\nThis guide is intended to be enough to get the Vagrant VM up and running. For additional information on Vagrant see [here](link to vagrant docs) or type `vagrant --help`.",

You can do that with this syntax:\n\n~~~{.sh}\nlog here\n~~~\n\nI\u0027m not convinced the log is the best way to help people though. Maybe instead give them a few heuristics to check their system - like verifying that they have a device at /dev/nvme0 after they SSH in. My only concern with the log is that people will gloss over it because it is a long string of unfamiliar text.",
