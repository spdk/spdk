      "message": "Hi Artur,\n\nThis patch series is looking really good to me so far.  I have a question here though.  What is the case where raid_bdev_module_find() would return NULL, but raid_bdev_level_to_str would return a string?  I\u0027m just thinking it would all be simpler to just say \"Unsupported raid level X\" in all cases, where X is the level\u0027s integer value.\n\n-Jim",
