      "message": "OK - I see.  But that really wasn\u0027t obvious reading the code here (regarding why we need to call _set_pmd() if we got -ENOENT).\n\nCould you just move this line from _set_pmd() to wherever the comp_bdev is initially created?\n\ncomp_dev-\u003edrv_name \u003d \"None\";\n\nThen we know drv_name will always be set and we can move this _set_pmd() call after the -ENOENT check.\n\nI like how that looks too in the case where the bdev is orphaned - it will show the drv_name as \"None\" which is technically more correct.",
