      "message": "so just a nit here (and similar for some of the other modified functions below)\n\nto reduce the amount of code change, you can just add this line after the nvme_bdev_ctrlr declaration:\n\nstruct spdk_nvme_ctrlr *ctrlr \u003d nvme_bdev_ctrlr-\u003ectrlr;\n\nThen you don\u0027t need to change the two lines below - they can still refer to the ctrlr variable.\n\nThis surely isn\u0027t a critical change.  I\u0027m OK with it as is and am keeping my +2 on this version.",
