      "message": "EXPERIMENTAL: A new opal bdev has been added to support management of\nNVMe self-encrypting SSDs through the Opal specification.  Users can\ncreate opal bdevs from a nvme namespace bdev, if the controller\ncontaining that namespace supports Opal.  Currently this is only\nsupported for namespace ID\u003d1.  The following RPCs have been added to\nsupport Opal: \u003clist RPCs here\u003e.  It does not yet support recreating the\nopal bdevs after application restart.  This bdev module should be\nconsidered very experimental, and the RPCs may change significantly\nin future releases.",
