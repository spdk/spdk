      "message": "Thanks for the input Pawel, After a couple conversations I had with Ben and Lance on Friday, I think we are going to do a lot of consolidation of libraries. The legacy behavior has been to create a library for each directory under the lib folder. I think this worked a year ago, but it is time for a refresh. In this change I will remove libspdk_rte_vhost from the ignored libs list, and in a subsequent consolidation patch, I will consolidate it into the vhost library.",

      "message": "Seth, with respect to the future, we need to ensure we take a very careful approach to the library consolidation.  I am supporting an internal customer seeking to minimize their software footprint when using the SPDK.   They are using a very limited subset of the SPDK now and so I\u0027d like to minimize the risk (or scope) of breaking their build as well as pulling in bigger chunks than they will ever need.",
