      "message": "Hi Shuhei, thanks for your review. Let me answer the questions.\n(1) Under worst case, a drive can take 7-8 minutes for revert operation (that is based on our test, maybe some drives can take longer). If we shutdown the target right after the revert is triggered, it will take 7-8 minutes to wait here for the worst case.\n(2) As far as I can see, if bdev_nvme_ctrlr_destruct is called, and the opal_poller hasn\u0027t been unregistered yet, this is the only way.",
