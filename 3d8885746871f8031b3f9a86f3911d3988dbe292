      "message": "The error it was complaining about was an invalid memory free.\nIn spdk_bdev_part_construct, it makes a call to spdk_bdev_module_claim_bdev. In the event that this function returns an error, we try to free part-\u003einternal.bdev.name which points to the name argument we pass in.\nScan-build was complaining because we didn\u0027t allocate these names on the heap.\nSo I allocated them with malloc to silence the first error, and then check the return code to make sure that we don\u0027t free them twice.",
