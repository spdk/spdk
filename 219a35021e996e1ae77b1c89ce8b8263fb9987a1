      "message": "Maybe need to have a little more about the difference between these two.\n\nLike \n\nFIO with nvme driver is to directly integrate with SPDK NVMe driver through those public APIs. Details refer to @ref nvme.\n\nFIO with bdev layer is to integrate with SPDK common block layer and can support different backend block devices. Details refer to @ref bdev.\n\nUsage of these two FIO supports has different aspects:\n\n1. FIO with nvme driver is more focusing and suitable on the I/O performance testing with NVMe SSD backend.\n2. FIO with bdev layer is to have more generic testing and functionalities with common block device handling.",
