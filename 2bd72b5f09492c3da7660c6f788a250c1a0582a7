      "message": "Could this create potential extra overhead on I/O that don\u0027t have prchk enabled? Since we have to do the I/O twice, if the failure wasn\u0027t related to protection information and we send it down again, we\u0027ll just get another failure. If we can check that here, we could avoid doing the extra work I think.",
