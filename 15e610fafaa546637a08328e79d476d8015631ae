      "message": "I think I see what you\u0027re doing here - let me explain it and you tell me if I\u0027m right or wrong. You want to catch the case where someone calls spdk_bdev_unregister twice, so you want to add a check to spdk_bdev_unregister to look at whether the status is already REMOVING. However, spdk_bdev_close currently calls spdk_bdev_unregister when the last handle to the bdev is closed, and in that case spdk_bdev_unregister should not fail this new status check\n\nIf I\u0027m understanding the problem correctly, I would have solved this by creating the following series of patches:\n\n1. Rename the existing spdk_bdev_unregister to spdk_bdev_unregister_unsafe() and take the locks and the call to spdk_bdev_fini out of it. Otherwise it remains identical. Add a new spdk_bdev_unregister that takes the lock and calls spdk_bdev_unregister_unsafe, and if it return successfully calls spdk_bdev_fini.\n2. Update the spdk_bdev_close() path to call spdk_bdev_unregister_unsafe()/spdk_bdev_fini() instead of calling spdk_bdev_unregister.\n3. Add a check for the bdev status in spdk_bdev_unregister.",

Only diff is:\n1. Rename\n - spdk_bdev_unregister_continue\n + spdk_bdev_unregister_unsafe\n\n2. Move to spdk_bdev_unregister_unsafe\n  - check if spdk_get_thread() !\u003d NULL\n  - check if internal.status !\u003d REMOVING\n\n#1 is pure sed so ok if you like it I can change it\n#2 is usless to check it from spdk_bdev_close()\n\nBut as you are the more experienced here something obvious could be overlooked by me. Do you want me to do #2 ?",
