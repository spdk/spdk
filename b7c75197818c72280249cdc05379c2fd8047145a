      "message": "This global fdisk-\u003ereset_in_progress flag isn\u0027t necessary and introduces race conditions. Remove it.\n\nThe generic bdev layer will only send a single reset at a time, so you don\u0027t have to guard against that here. In bdev_aio_reset, just call spdk_for_each_channel. In the completion callback for the iteration, if it succeeded complete the I/O. If it failed, start a poller for 1ms and then call spdk_for_each_channel again.",
