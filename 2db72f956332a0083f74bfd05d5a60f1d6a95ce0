      "message": "I don\u0027t think this will give us the accuracy that we need.  We have a few cases:\n\n1) compare fails due to miscompute - compare status should be MISCOMPARE, and write status should be ABORTED_FAILED_FUSED\n2) compare fails for other reason - compare status should be some kind of failure (maybe INTERNAL_DEVICE_ERROR), and write status should be ABORTED_FAILED_FUSED\n3) compare succeeds but write fails - compare status should be SUCCESS, write status should be INTERNAL_DEVICE_ERROR\n\nI think we may need something like spdk_bdev_io_get_nvme_fused_status() which would allow passing status for both the first and second commands.  Then we indicate that this function should be used when getting status for a completed compare-and-write operation.",
