      "message": "since you\u0027re not comparing read/write just use one buffer in this example.  Also given how simple the example is you might want to just use a few globals instead of a context structure that\u0027s passed back and forth.  I did that in the hello_world for blob just because I had a lot of stuff and wanted to show how the use of callback args could prevent requiring ugly globals (IMHO)",

Not a big deal but something to think about so the example here doesn\u0027t use the argv array values directly",
