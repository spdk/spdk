      "message": "It looks to me like nvmf_rdma_fill_wr_sge is just a special case of this function where _remaining_data_block \u003d iov_len, *_offset \u003d 0, and md_size \u003d 0.\nI think from a code reuse perspective you could combine the two functions.\nThis function is also a little bit slower I think, so if you wanted to keep the two separate to keep the fast / slow path, I\u0027m OK with that as well. So basically take or leave this comment, I just wanted to bring it up in case you hadn\u0027t thought of it.",
