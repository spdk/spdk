      "message": "yes, Daniel, \"is supported\" API should be added.\nI\u0027ve synced with Jakub before. That this API would not block the patch working of OCSSD other drivers, so I can extract and resubmit it later before we are going to setup related test.\n\nSince it maybe placed into files \"nvme_ocssd.h\" and \"nvme_ocssd_ctrlr_cmd.c\" which are also new added files in Jakub\u0027s patch https://review.gerrithub.io/c/spdk/spdk/+/412816 \nSo I\u0027m going to add this patch after Jakub\u0027s above patch is merged.",
