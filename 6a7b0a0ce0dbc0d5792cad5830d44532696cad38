I see a bunch of existing places where various memory allocation failures trigger calling _spdk_bs_free() followed by some operation on a sequence object.  _spdk_bs_free() will free the md channel though which the sequence was allocated from.\n\nLet\u0027s talk about this more once you\u0027re back from SDC.",
