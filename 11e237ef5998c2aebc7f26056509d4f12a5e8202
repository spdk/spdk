      "message": "Hi Ziye,\n\nFor creating NVMe bdevs by .INI config file, -w and -b work as expected without this patch. -w and -b don\u0027t degrade .INI config file behavior. Hence I don\u0027t think this patch lose compatibility to old DPDKs.\n\nFor construct_nvme_bdev RPC, -w and -b didn\u0027t work at all. Hence I pushed this patch.\n\nHowever this patch is not complete. After this patch, -w and -b don\u0027t cause error but work as NOP.\n\nHence changing DPDK is necessary.\n\nWill you take a look at https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues/362 ?",
