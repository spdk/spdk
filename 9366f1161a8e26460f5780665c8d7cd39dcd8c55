      "message": "I am open to other opinions, but I would prefer to keep the dump code the way it is (each LUN is an object inside of an array, rather than parallel arrays of lun_ids and bdev_names where the index match up; the same applies to the pg_ig_maps vs. pg_tags/ig_tags arrays above).\n\nTo make these consistent, we would then need to change the construct_target_node RPC method instead; this does mean breaking backwards compatibility, but I think we can make this change now to allow greater flexibility in the future (e.g. the LUN object could have new, optional fields added as needed without breaking backwards compatibility).",
