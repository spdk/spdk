The GPT partition is sitting on the disk before the iSCSI target runs, so it will be there during the initial examine pass. I think this test works just fine if you don\u0027t send this RPC at all.",

      "message": "Hi Ben,\n\nI know that. \n1 Another patch is need to dynamically part the device with GPT (which should add a service to combine the nbd function)\n\n2 And this RPC also has feature if detected with already parted device with GPT, it will be return the partition. So it still test our rpc examine function.",
