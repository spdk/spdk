      "message": "Should we provide an output parameter for the NVMe status code?  Currently we always return errno-like values - my concern is that returning SPDK_NVME_SC_FIRMWARE_REQ_CONVENTIONAL_RESET will be very non-standard.\n\nI think if the update firmware was successful, this function should always return 0.  Let the output parameter tell the caller whether they need to follow up with a conventional reset.",
