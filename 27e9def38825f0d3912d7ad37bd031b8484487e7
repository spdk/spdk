      "message": "should we just check ctrlr-\u003enum_ns at the beginning of this function, and return immediately if it is 0?\n\nwe don\u0027t need to calculate num_pages if ctrlr-\u003enum_ns is zero\n\nyou could also just add an assert(ctrlr-\u003enum_ns \u003e 0) at the beginning of this function - if you skip this state during initialization, this function should never get called since async events and attach/detach/delete ns are not possible when cdata.nn \u003d\u003d 0",
