      "message": "Those DPDK changes are shaping up on our 19.02-test-vhost branch. They will be eventually submitted to the upstream DPDK.\n\nvirtio-vhost-user support requires some changes in SPDK around rte_vhost APIs - the controller creation RPCs can now either create unix domain sockets or connect to PCI devices. In order to keep the SPDK code simple and free of #ifdefs, we just \"mock\" the missing functionality here.\n\nI don\u0027t think this and other SPDK virtio-vhost-user patches need to be merged just yet. There\u0027s not much value of them being in the upstream without the actual virtio-vhost-user functionality being there as well.",
