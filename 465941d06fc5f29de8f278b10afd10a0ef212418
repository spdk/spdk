      "message": "we should use the same scheme as blobstore and blobfs for determining whether a blobfs exists\n\nmeaning just say that -EILSEQ means that no blobfs was found; any other error means there was some problem with detecting\n\nthat drastically simplifies the code and makes it consistent with existing blobstore/blobfs code",

      "message": "I think the RPC name should just be \"blobfs_detect\".  I don\u0027t think we need bdev in the name.  We don\u0027t pretend to support blobfs on anything except bdev right now.  And with all of the RPC renaming we have done, \"bdev_blobfs\" would indicate a bdev module named \"blobfs\" which isn\u0027t accurate (i.e. all of our RPCs are named things like bdev_malloc_create, bdev_split_create, etc.)",
