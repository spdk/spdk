      "message": "why do we not abort these tasks in all of the error cases in this function now?  that seems unrelated to the indirect descriptors\n\nit looks like this will return -1 to process_request which in turn returns it to process_requestq and then calls invalid_request() on it - but I don\u0027t see where we set a response for the task before doing so\n\nregardless, seems this part of the change should be moved out to a separate patch\n\nupdate: ok now i see that before it always set task-\u003eresp \u003d NULL so wouldn\u0027t actually set ABORTED response so this is effectively the same functionality but simpler; but still would rather see this done in a prep patch before this one",
