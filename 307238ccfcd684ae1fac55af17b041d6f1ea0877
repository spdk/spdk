      "message": "this whole interrupt thing is pretty destructive - it not only moves interrupts off of core 0 (or adds them back here now in the reset routine) but it will also enable interrupts on a lot of cores where they weren\u0027t previously\n\nthis happens a lot with NICs for example - they do per-core interrupts (just one bit set in smp_affinity) and now we overwrite that with all 1\u0027s except bit 0\n\ni\u0027d be more tempted to just leave the interrupts alone in the reset routine for now",
