      "message": "Hi Shuhei,\n\nI like and understand the reasons for this patch.  I have an idea - maybe not a good one - but would like your input.\n\nWhat if we do not add any new -c option here?  And have load_config just always check the current state of the target.  If subsystems have already been initialized, just print a message like \"Skipping any subsystem initialization RPCs since SPDK application has already initialized subsystems.\"\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
