      "message": "I\u0027m a little confused. This was the API we talked about in our 1:1 (or I thought it was). Last time through, I replaced the enum with a trid, but that was too broad. Then I asked you if we should have two different functions for determining if a transport is available, one for custom and one for traditional transports and you said no. So I just kept the single API, but changed it to use a  string instead of the enum so it could work for all transports. . .\nPlease let me know which way you would like me to handle this, and if I am mis-remembering our conversation, which API were we talking about then?",
