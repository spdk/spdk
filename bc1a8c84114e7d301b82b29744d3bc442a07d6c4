      "message": "These new RPC methods should be added to scripts/rpc.py and scripts/rpc/iscsi.py.\n\nIdeally, some test scripts that call these new methods via rpc.py would be added too.  Maybe it would be possible to modify an existing iscsi_tgt test to configure the initiator group via this RPC instead of by static configuration?",

      "message": "Thank you. \n\nFor example if user register\n- ANY as common to all initiators to initiator_list,\n- each initiator\u0027s IP address to netmask_list,\n\nfirst  call has both parameters, but second call and later will have only netmask parameter.\n\nI can imagine the opposite use case too.\n\nHence I would like to treat 0 as a valid case for both add and delete.\n\n\nIdeally it may be better for iSCSI to be able to ignore already added parameters, but it will require reference count and be a little complex as a first effort.",
