      "message": "It is not really clear how adding this line performs what is described in the commit message.  We take this code path for non-error cases - so having this call here seems confusing.\n\nNote that end_target does three things:\n\n1) unregister run_timer\n2) unregister reset_timer\n3) set is_draining flag\n\nIt ends up working OK to call end_target multiple times (since spdk_poller_unregister() will set the poller pointer to NULL), but I think it\u0027s confusing to call it like this here.  The normal path is that the run_timer expires, which sets is_draining \u003d true, and then we eventually get to this point.  Calling end_target() again doesn\u0027t make sense in that case.",

      "message": "Hi Jim,\n\nThanks for your review. My patch was not enough. What we should do is to unregister pollers for all places that sets target-\u003eis_draining to true. So I inserted a patch and updated this patch. Please take a look at this patch again.\n\nBesides, I undershot the target but I reduced the number of patches from 33 to 21. I hope if this reduction will reduce the burden of reviewers. This may be the best I can do now.\n\nThanks,\nShuhei",
