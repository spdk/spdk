      "message": "I think it would be simpler to ensure that qpair-\u003eqid is in range; this should guarantee that we have not exceeded the num_qpairs limit if the qpair-\u003eqid bit is clear in the next check.\n\nWe might even be able to get rid of num_qpairs entirely, although it\u0027s probably convenient to keep it just to have a fast way to check if all queues have been disconnected.",
