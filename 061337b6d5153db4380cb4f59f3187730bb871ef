      "message": "Different descriptors can be open for the same bdev and they\u0027ll all use the same I/O channel. Further, this will just get the I/O channel for the current thread, but the user is free to submit I/O on another channel but with this same descriptor. Finally, if you never call spdk_put_io_channel you\u0027ll never release your ref count on the channel and it will never be destroyed.\n\nPutting the rate limitations on the channel does not seem viable to me. I think it either needs to be in the bdev or in the descriptor. We\u0027ll then have to figure out how to make it thread safe to access.",
