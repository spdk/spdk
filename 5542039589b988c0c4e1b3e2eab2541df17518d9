      "message": "I see how this works, but I think it\u0027s a bit nasty.  What if instead we added a new backend function pointer for \"get_lcore\" or something like that?  then for blk and nvme, it can just use spdk_vhost_allocate_reactor as is, but scsi can do something different - i.e. use spdk_vhost_allocate_reactor for the first session, save that lcore in the svdev, and then use that lcore for subsequent sessions\n\nI just think that\u0027s a lot more clear than all of this vdev-\u003ecpumask manipulation.",
