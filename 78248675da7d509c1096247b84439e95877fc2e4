If raid bdev config add is successful but all the base bdevs failed for raid_bdev_add_base_device, in this case we are making rpc successful but there is hanging configuration without raid_bdev created. We should create raid bdev in configuring state even if no base bdev is added, please check if it makes sense.\n\n\n2. Also, check_and_remove_raid_bdev() does this require to call? I think whatever base bdevs are added let it add and not remove. Anyway user can fire rpc delete",
