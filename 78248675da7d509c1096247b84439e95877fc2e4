      "message": "1. If raid bdev config add is successful but all the base bdevs failed for raid_bdev_add_base_device, in this case we are making rpc successful but there is hanging configuration without raid_bdev created. We should create raid bdev in configuring state even if no base bdev is added, please check if it makes sense.\n\n\n2. Also, check_and_remove_raid_bdev() does this require to call? I think whatever base bdevs are added let it add and not remove. Anyway user can fire rpc delete",

      "message": "Hi Kunal,\n\nThank you so much for your feedback. Both of your feedback should be taken.\n\n#1, thank you for very nice proposal. Your idea looks very reasonable to me. I will take yours and update this patch.\n\n#2, skipping base bdev and failing to add base bdev are the same from the viewpoint of the raid bdev. Hence as you say, I think we can remove check_and_remove_raid_bdev() and I\u0027ll do it.\n\nThanks,\nShuhei",
