If the load balancing algorithm is by host IP, that will only return cores on which there is a poll group (because there are necessarily other connections) or fall back to round robin, which is also what you want.",

      "message": "For the first connection by host IP, it will fall back to round robin to get one core and add the g_nvmf_tgt_host_trids. The potential issue here is that the pg-\u003egroup for the current core is NULL. Later, for the same host IP, it will find the existing entry and the g_nvmf_tgt_host_trids and always get the same core and NULL gp-\u003egroup. To avoid this, if getting core through nvmf_tgt_get_qpair_core() fails, remove the added entry and call again to get the next core.",
