I think you need to add another list in spdk_json_request something like:\n\nSTAILQ_HEAD(, spdk_jsonrpc_request) batch_queue;\nSTAILQ_ENTRY(spdk_jsonrpc_request) batch_link;\n\nand put all sub-requests there. There will be required some atomic counter there to see how many batch sub-requests are  still in progress when calling end_response().",
