Right now its only performed from RPC which is basically the same as app init thread and cleaner_thread.\n\nIf one were to assume that vbdev_ocf_delete() is called from thread !\u003d cleaner_thread. Then how do we go back to original caller after put_cleaner_channel() ?\n\nOverall I\u0027m not sure if any of message passing is required when using any of provided frameworks - app init or rpc.",
