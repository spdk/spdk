      "message": "The original idea for those was to be able to use the same virtqueue for multiple io_channels.\nOnce an io_channel wants to acquire a virtqueue and there aren\u0027t any unused ones available, it could choose the least occupied one and switch it\u0027s poller into a multi-thread mode. The poller_ctx would then keep the MP-SC spdk_ring for all the requests to be sent. The virtqueue poller in a multi-thread mode would poll this ring and send the requests to the real virtqueue.\nWe deferred implementing that idea, but it\u0027s still a nice-to-have feature that can be implemented in future with not so much effort.",
