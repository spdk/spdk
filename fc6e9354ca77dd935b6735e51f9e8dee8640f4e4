      "message": "The idea behind calling probe here was that we can overlap NVMe controller startup (reset, etc.) for many controllers at once; if we call spdk_bdev_nvme_create() for each transport ID, the startup becomes serialized again.\n\nI\u0027m not totally opposed to moving away from probing all devices at once if it\u0027s for a good reason, but this looks like a startup performance regression without a good reason.",
