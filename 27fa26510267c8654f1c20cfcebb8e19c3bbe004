      "message": "Hi Wenzhong,\n\nShould these changes be test/nvmf?  Most of these are are using $bdfs which implies PCI direct-attached NVMe, not NVMe over Fabrics.\n\nThis script does not depend on any direct-attached NVMe devices currently.  If a system had the nvme-cli directory, but no PCI NVMe SSDs, this test would fail.\n\nI think it would be better to create a new test script under test/lib/nvme, and call it from test/lib/nvme/nvme.sh.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
