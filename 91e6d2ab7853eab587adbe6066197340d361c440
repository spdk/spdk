      "message": "I don\u0027t think this works here.  There are a number of places where the state gets advanced outside of this function - data for those transitions would be missed.\n\nFor example, see case RDMA_WR_TYPE_SEND in spdk_nvmf_rdma_poller_poll.  It advances state to RDMA_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETED, and then calls spdk_nvmf_rdma_request_process (this function).  prev_state \u003d\u003d RDMA_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETED, so you wouldn\u0027t update the latencies here.\n\nTo do this properly we\u0027d probably need to add a macro that\u0027s always used to advance the request state.  But I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s something we should try to add for 19.07.",

We can look at a newer version of this in the future.\n\nI\u0027m removing the 19.07 tag from this patch.  I think you can abandon this patch too (most likely a future implementation would look a lot different).",
