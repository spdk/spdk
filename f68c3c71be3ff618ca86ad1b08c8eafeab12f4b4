      "message": "ok - I think I understand now why you\u0027re adding these bdevs_done and ctrlr_done booleans - you are preparing for ocssd to create bdevs asynchronously\n\nbut I really think ocssd needs to create its bdevs with some kind of context separate from this probe ctx - but maybe we can defer that for now and continue with this approach you have here\n\nI still think it\u0027s a bit difficult to understand though.  For example, you\u0027ve added bdevs_done *and* ctrlr_done, but you don\u0027t call nvme_bdev_attach_done here.  I\u0027d suggest adding that call now in this patch, with a comment explaining that it\u0027s not needed now but will be in the future.\n\nI\u0027d also suggest the following changes:\n\n1) nvme_bdev_attach_done should always call the callback and free the ctx - don\u0027t have it check bdevs_done, ctrlr_done or rc at all\n2) then here you can do something like:\n     if (ctx-\u003ectrlr_done) {\n       nvme_bdev_attach_done();\n     } else {\n       ctx-\u003ebdevs_done \u003d true;\n     }\n3) do something similar in bdev_nvme_async_poll (but in reverse - check bdevs_done, and set ctrlr_done in the else case)\n4) instead of \"ctrlr_done\", let\u0027s call it \"probe_done\"",
