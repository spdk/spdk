      "message": "should this be an assert()?\n\nit seems like if this case ever happens, then this poller will never do anything\n\nan SPDK_ERRLOG would be nice, but if this case hit then we would just print this message over and over again\n\nwhat do you think about just leaking the channel if this case happens, by setting rqpair-\u003emgmt_channel \u003d NULL?  then next time it will allocate a channel for the correct thread",

      "message": "This case will be happen. Since the channel is created by acceptor, and it will be shift to subsystem core to schedule. And when it is handled by acceptor core, we should not let the subsystem call to poll it.\n\n\nFor the logic, set the mgmt_channel to NULL is not correct. Since We already have this logic spdk_nvmf_rdma_accept. \n\nFor multiple core usage cases,  accept is driven by acceptor_core, and subsystem poll is driven by subsystem core. And the transition from acceptor core to subsystem is core is that the fabric commands is handled",
