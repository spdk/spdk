      "message": "I think this is certainly something we\u0027re going to need to work out eventually. iSCSI was written originally to have a fixed number of system threads and then dynamically shift the connections between them. NVMe-oF can\u0027t do that (RDMA can\u0027t move connections between \"groups\" like sockets can), so instead NVMe-oF relies on spawning a bunch of lightweight threads and then load balancing the lightweight threads onto the system threads. Connections are owned by the same lightweight thread for their entire lifetime.\n\nUltimately, I think the NVMe-oF design works out better and there\u0027s no reason iSCSI couldn\u0027t work similarly. iSCSI was just written way before NVMe-oF and lightweight threads existed.",
