I haven\u0027t looked at the rest of this series, but I think people are going to be confused why we use suite and case interchangeably especially when they are all calling scripts.  rpc_client.sh is a bit easy to see, since if you open it up you see that it clearly only calls one application.  But json_config.sh is a lot more complicated - it\u0027s a huge script and it\u0027s not clear that we consider it a \"case\" only because it doesn\u0027t call run_test itself.",
