I\u0027ll push a version with the name fixed up.\n\nAs for adding this to bdev, we don\u0027t have a way to expose this right now (and this patch is just adding the NVMe spec definitions).  It is probably a good idea to expose a unique ID for each bdev, though, and this field could be useful for that purpose (for NVMe 1.3+ devices).",
