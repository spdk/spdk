As per documentation of descriptor flags below, if md_ro_flags contains flag that application does not know of - blob will only be opened in md_read_only mode. This means that any blob created with this patch, won\u0027t be able to be opened up with SPDK 19.10.\n\nMaybe internal_xattrs might be better place for it, since it solves backwards compatibility issue ?\nOn the other hand.. it complicates _spdk_bs_create_blob() since we already pass entries there.",
