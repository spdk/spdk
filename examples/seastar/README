SPDK with Seastar framework
===========================

This directory contains some examples for using SPDK libraries with the
Seastar framework.

Requires a debug build of Seastar to exist as a peer to the root of this
spdk repository.

"nvme" does a simple "Hello World" type flow with the SPDK nvme driver.

"spdk_tgt" is a fully functional SPDK target application.  Currently only
iSCSI is linked in but NVMe-oF and vhost will be added eventually.  I
have been able to create target nodes, discover them and login with this
target.

"sock" is a simple echo server built on top of the spdk sock library.
Currently it only uses the posix sock_impl but will be the basis for
experimenting with the seastar TCP stack.

Please use the suppressions.txt file to suppress an LSAN leak notification
from the ltdl library used by Seastar.

LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./nvme -c1
LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./spdk_tgt -c4
LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./sock -c1

Note that the -c4 option means how many cores to use (-c4 means 4 cores).

(A lot more details will be added here for how to run, todo items, etc.)

Instructions to build Seastar on Ubuntu 19.04:

# Clone seastar so it is a peer of spdk
git clone -b seastar-19.06.0 https://github.com/scylladb/seastar.git
cd seastar
sudo ./install-dependencies.sh

# On Ubuntu 19.04, I had to install pkg-config seperately
apt-get install pkg-config

# It's not clear why we have to "cook" fmt ourselves, but
# the Seastar documentation clearly spells it out as a common
# thing you have to do.
export http_proxy=http://proxy-chain.intel.com:911
export https_proxy=http://proxy-chain.intel.com:911
./configure.py --mode=debug --cook fmt

# There's a stdc++fs cmake issue on Ubuntu 19.04.  I created
# a patch to get it to work on my system.  If you're running
# on a different distro, you may want to try building first
# without this patch.
patch -p1 < ../spdk/examples/seastar/seastar.patch

ninja -C build/debug

# pkg-config for seastar seems to get this wrong on
# Ubuntu 19.04 at least
pushd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s libunistring.so.2 libunistring.so
popd

cd ../spdk/examples/seastar
make
sudo LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./spdk_tgt -c1
