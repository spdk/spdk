SPDK with Seastar framework
===========================

This directory contains some examples for using SPDK libraries with the
Seastar framework.

Requires a debug build of Seastar to exist as a peer to the root of this
spdk repository.

"nvme" does a simple "Hello World" type flow with the SPDK nvme driver.

"spdk_tgt" is a fully functional SPDK target application.  Currently only
iSCSI is linked in but NVMe-oF and vhost will be added eventually.  I
have been able to create target nodes, discover them and login with this
target.

Currently it only supports running on a single core.  Please use the
suppressions.txt file to suppress an LSAN leak notification from the
ltdl library used by Seastar.

LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./nvme -c1

or

LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=suppressions.txt ./spdk_tgt -c1

(A lot more details will be added here for how to run, todo items, etc.)
