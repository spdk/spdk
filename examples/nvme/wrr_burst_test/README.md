# WRR Burst Test Example

This example exercises NVMe Weighted Round Robin (WRR) arbitration by submitting large command bursts on multiple I/O queue pairs with different priorities. Each queue prepares its commands while the `delay_cmd_submit` feature is enabled; after all queues are primed the application rings every submission queue doorbell, allowing the controller to arbitrate a synchronized burst.

## Build

From the repository root run either build system (after a standard `./configure`):

```bash
ninja -C build examples/nvme/wrr_burst_test
```

or simply build everything:

```bash
make
```

> **Note**: Do not call `make -C examples/nvme wrr_burst_test`; that shortcut only compiles the object file in this directory and fails at link time because the SPDK libraries are not linked in. Let the top-level build drive the link step.

The resulting binary lives at `build/examples/nvme/wrr_burst_test/wrr_burst_test` (path may differ if you use a different build directory).

## Run

Before running, ensure the SPDK environment has access to hugepages. Allocate them via the provided script:

```bash
sudo HUGEMEM=8192 scripts/setup.sh
```

or manually reserve 2 MB pages and mount hugetlbfs. Without hugepages DPDK initialization fails with:

```
EAL: No free 2048 kB hugepages reported on node 0
[...]
Failed to initialize DPDK
```

Minimal command (local PCIe controller, defaults):

```bash
sudo build/examples/nvme/wrr_burst_test/wrr_burst_test
```

Useful options:

- `-r <trid>` NVMe transport ID (e.g. `trtype:PCIe` or `trtype:RDMA adrfam:IPv4 traddr:...`).
- `-C <num>` Commands per qpair (default 255).
- `-N <num>` Logical blocks per command (default 8).
- `-S <lba>` Starting LBA offset (default 0).
- `-Q <entries>` Queue depth / request pool size (default 512).
- `-O <path>` CSV output path (default `wrr_burst_log.csv`; use `-` for stdout).
- `--hpw`, `--mpw`, `--lpw` High/medium/low WRR weights (defaults 32/16/4).
- `--burst <0-7>` Arbitration burst value (default 7).
- `-W` Issue writes instead of reads.

To pin the test to a specific PCIe device, supply the BDF in the transport ID. For example:

```bash
sudo build/examples/nvme/wrr_burst_test/wrr_burst_test \
  -r "trtype:PCIe traddr:0000:81:00.0"
```

SPDK parses the `traddr` string and matches it against the controller's bus:device.function address during `spdk_nvme_probe()`, so only the selected device is attached.

At runtime the tool allocates nine qpairs (3 high, 3 medium, 3 low), primes each with 255 commands, rings all doorbells, then polls completions while recording timing metadata.

## Trace Support

Enable SPDK tracepoints to capture doorbell activity:

```bash
sudo build/examples/nvme/wrr_burst_test/wrr_burst_test -e nvme_pcie
```

After the run inspect the log with `build/bin/spdk_trace -s wrr_burst_test -p <pid>`.

## Output

The CSV contains one row per command with:

- submission sequence index
- qpair ID and priority class
- command ID, opcode, SLBA, NLB
- submit / complete timestamps (Âµs) and latency
- completion status string

## Error

## 1. max queue deepth is 511, then the base LBA between two queues is 0x2000
## 2. arbitration burst can be 0, which means 2^ab(e.g.0) = 1
