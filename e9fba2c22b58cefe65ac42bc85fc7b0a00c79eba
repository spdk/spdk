      "message": "I\u0027d suggest making had_lock a bool, and do something like:\n\nhad_lock \u003d (nvme_robust_mutex_unlock() \u003d\u003d 0);\n\n(Parentheses aren\u0027t technically required, but makes it more readable in my opinion.)\n\nOtherwise when had_lock \u003d EPERM, it means we really didn\u0027t have the lock, and then below you only try to lock if had_lock was 0.  I think you want it to read:\n\nif (had_lock) {\n  nvme_robust_mutex_lock();\n}",
