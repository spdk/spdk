If the path string matches the pci address format (e.g. can be parsed with spdk_pci_addr_parse), then it could be automatically assumed to be a PCI address. We wouldn\u0027t allow creating any UNIX domain socket files named DDDD:BB:DD:FF this way, but I don\u0027t see why anyone would need that.",

      "message": "Yes, we can detect the transport in rte_vhost_driver_register() based on the `path` format, but I don\u0027t see any reason for doing this. Given that we know the vhost-user transport here, why should we re-find it in rte_vhost? Besides, it is trivial to pass this info through the second argument. rte_vhost_driver_register() already has this second \"flags\" argument. All we have to do is to define a new flag for the virtio-vhost-user transport.",
