The tgt argument is used to find the transport for the trid-\u003etrtype.\n\nThe operation of adding the transports to the channels was asynchrounous. That\u0027s no longer done in this function anymore.  This function simply calls the transport\u0027s  listen function to add the listener.  That was always done directly, not asynchronously.",

Either:\n\n1) spdk_nvmf_tgt_transport_create can be made asynchronous and spdk_nvmf_add_transport can be removed.\n\n2) spdk_nvmf_tgt_transport_create becomes instead spdk_nvmf_transport_create and is synchronous and doesn\u0027t take the tgt as a parameter. And spdk_nvmf_add_transport becomes spdk_nvmf_tgt_add_transport but otherwise mostly works the same way.\n\nI slightly prefer #2 and I think #2 also leads to solutions for some other unrelated problems we have.",
