      "message": "I think this is really non-intuitive.  I\u0027m having a hard time getting my head around it which makes me think it will be even harder for new folks coming into SPDK to be able to use.  This seems to be hardcoded around an int-size allocations - what happens for other unit tests or functions that need something bigger?\n\nMaybe for now we drop this part (and the part of the unit test that uses it) until we can look for a solution that\u0027s a bit easier to understand?",

      "message": "I\u0027d rather not drop it, let me think on it some more but yeah its not something you can glance at an know how to use. The int is really just about the pass through value, the return is the * which can be set to point to anything. For passthrough it points to an int though. maybe if I use a different name for it and a new MOCK macro so it doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027re setting a return value.",
