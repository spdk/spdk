      "message": "The problem I ran into is that for cross compilers, I thought it would obviously just take -march\u003dnative (and it would build for the native platform that the compiler is intended for). But for whatever reason, using -march\u003dnative on the arm cross compiler on x86 tries to make it target x86. Bad compiler design, imo.\n\nSo we have to deal with that somehow, which I think means that in order to use a cross compiler, you also must explicitly set the TARGET_ARCH. I\u0027ll make the change to use native if the user doesn\u0027t set it explicitly.",
