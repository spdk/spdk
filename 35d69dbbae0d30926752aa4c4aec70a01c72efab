      "message": "Instead of picking a threshold of 10 here, let\u0027s use a new trace flag instead (you can call it \"reactor\").  Then always do the SPDK_TRACELOG if nivcsw incremented.  So by default, it will not get printed but we can enable it easily with a trace flag.\n\nCan you also print out differences in ru_nvcsw as well?\n\nNote to other reviewers: we do get very intermittent context switches especially when running on core 0.  For example, igb has a watchdog that runs on core 0 every 2 seconds.  There\u0027s also a pci_pme_list_scan routine that gets scheduled every 2 seconds on core 0 - at least on my system.  And then when these things get scheduled, we might do a debug print here, and the debug print also kicks the worker thread to run flush_to_ldisc.",
