      "message": "Should we cache the sgroup in the spdk_nvmf_request?  there are 7 pointer chases here to get the sgroup - I could definitely see this impacting performance.\n\nThat would bump spdk_nvmf_request from 32 to 40 bytes.  But its included in spdk_nvmf_rdma_request which is currently 384 bytes - so another 8 bytes isn\u0027t terrible.",

      "message": "I think so, but I\u0027ll do it in the next patch because there are more places than just here that need to reference the cached value. We historically didn\u0027t cache because sgroups could get reallocated. However, that was causing all sorts of problems and I just inserted a patch before this one that puts an end to that. So now that the memory won\u0027t move, we should definitely do more caching.",
