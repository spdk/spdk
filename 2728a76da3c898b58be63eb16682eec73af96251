      "message": "Similar to Jim\u0027s comment. Those depend heavily on what else was configured on a particular test system.\n\nThere could be cases where we want to run them on some systems while not on others (ex. jobs nvme_autotest and nvme_phy_autotest cover same configure flags). Yet I feel such decision should be done by each particular configuration for a job.\n\nI\u0027m fine if this patch would only consolidate the tests/flags that don\u0027t depend on configuration options. So the savings in test time you are describing would by having the consolidated tests ran just once on single job.\nMeanwhile configure dependent tests we would need to fine tune in job configs.\n\nOfftopic: @Seth would it be possible to generate output from scan-build which files were scanned, so that we could verify all files are (along with new ones) ?",

      "message": "Thanks for the comment Tomek! I agree that we need to make sure that all compilation options are covered under scan-build (and the shared object build validation).\nIf I remember correctly, the goal of the unittest job was to move all of that into a single place to help weed out failing builds earlier in the build cycle. So my hope was to enable autobuild only on that machine. Currently that is the only job configured to run scan-build.\nJim\u0027s comment helped me to realize that we curently have at least one conflict that prevents us from doing that. That is between compressdev and RBD.\nI really like your idea about generating the output from scan-build about which files were touched. I will look into that. I think that is the only reliable way to enforce complete coverage for scan-build.",
