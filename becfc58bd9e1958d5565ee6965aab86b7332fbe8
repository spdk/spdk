      "message": "This looks good - moving this code here after we\u0027ve opened the blob.\n\nBut I think you should move this code in a separate patch before this one.  This is actually more accurate, even before adding your new locked_operation_in_progress flag.  Currently (without your patch), someone could create a clone of this blob while it is being opened for deletion.  So I think you can have one patch that moves this code and explains why it is being moved.  Then this patch here only adds the locked_operation_in_progress flag.",
