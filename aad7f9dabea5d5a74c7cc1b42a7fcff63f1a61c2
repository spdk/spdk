      "message": "Hi Maciek,\n\nThis doesn\u0027t help anything.  $! and wait will only work when the process is running in the background.\n\n\u003eecho foobar\nfoobar\n\u003eecho $!\n\n\u003ewait\n\u003eecho $?\n0\n\nSince the first echo is not backgrounded, $! does not get set.  So then the wait command here just becomes \"wait\".  And wait with no arguments does nothing, and exits with success.\n\nIn fact, this will probably make things worse, because you don\u0027t have the \"sleep 2\" anymore.  :-)\n\n\n-Jim",
