I would expect that compression will just make this slower overall.\n\nCan you do a test with the tar command but no compression and see how the times compare?\n\nIt might also be good to put the tarball in /tmp (or even pipe the output of tar directly into the SSH command) to avoid needing to write it to disk.",
