But I think we need to make it even more clear how this works.\n\nI think the existing comment is fine.  But then lets add:\n\nThis callback must makes its decision to claim the module synchronously.  It must also call spdk_bdev_module_examine_done() before returning.  If the module needs to performance asynchronous operations such as I/O after claiming the bdev, it may define an examine_disk callback.  The examine_disk callback will then be called immediately after the examine_config callback returns.\n\n(Technically it\u0027s not \"immediate\", but I\u0027m afraid trying to explain it in more specific terms will just confuse.)",
