      "message": "This change makes the code not clear.  Previously, maybe the code was slightly incorrect, but it makes sense that one the number completed equals the number of base bdevs, that we complete the parent IO.\n\nBut comparing the number completed to the \"reset_waiting\" is not clear.  Maybe reset_expected would be a better name?",
