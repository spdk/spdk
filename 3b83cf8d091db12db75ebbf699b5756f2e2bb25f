      "message": "This is going to break calls to vhost_kill. $vhost_name will now resolve to a full path instead of just the basename. You will need to apply the same trick you did in nvmf or just fix the way vhost_kill uses this variable (which would be a simplification). A third option would be to just remove this at_app_exit function entirely since it\u0027s only used in the error path in a single file and could easily be replaced with calls to vhost_kill vhost0. That\u0027s actually my favorite solution.\n\nThe reason this didn\u0027t come up is at_app_exit only gets called in the error path.",
