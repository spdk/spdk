      "message": "Hi, Karol\n\nI think you can define the function get_lvs_free_mb() and get_lbd_size() in autotest_comman.sh,So that anyone who test lvol backend can call these function.Because not only vhost need to test lvol backend but also nvmf and iscsi is need to test with lvol backebd too. So may I call the function later when your patch merged? I think define in autotest_comman.sh can reduce the code repeat.What is your ideal?\n\nThanks\nWenzhong",

      "message": "Whoever needs the functions first should go ahead and merge them as part of their patch, especially since they\u0027re pretty small.  If they\u0027re really big it may require more coordination (through the review process) but for these, I\u0027d say Wenzhong go ahead and add them to your patch where you feel they fit (and if we change that at some later date that\u0027s fine too)",
