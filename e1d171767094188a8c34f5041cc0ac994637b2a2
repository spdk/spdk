      "message": "For all of these global_rc checks - you *must* set global_rc to the opposite value before calling spdk_subsystem_init().\n\nThis ensures that global_rc was set correctly during the spdk_subsystem_init() context.  Otherwise it is possible that global_rc could still contain an old value and never get updated and then passes the CU_ASSERT().\n\nPlease let me know if you do not understand my meaning.  I have tried to make this point in the last two versions of this patch but I have not seen any updates.  :-)",
