      "message": "I still think we should have helper functions here - or at least use a loop.  This is still all very hardcoded - UT_MBUFS_PER_OP_BOUND_TEST may be set to 4, but all of the code here still implicitly depends on that value being set to 4.\n\nUsing a loop makes the code more flexible, in case we need to add more mbufs in the future.",
