      "message": "In this FC implementation, the FC layer is allocating its own pool of bdev_io. That\u0027s backward from the SPDK model where the bdev layer owns all of the bdev_io objects. This will need to be reworked into the SPDK model to get merged.\n\nI\u0027m familiar with the history of why this is the way it is, but with the current SPDK bdev_io pooling strategy the original reasons for doing this are no longer valid. It\u0027s important architecturally to SPDK to manage the bdev_io in the bdev layer.\n\nThe transport should know nothing about the bdev layer.",
