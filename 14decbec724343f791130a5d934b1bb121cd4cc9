      "message": "Is this minimum value based on the spec?  If so, let\u0027s add a #define for it in include/spdk/nvme.h and use that #define here.\n\nActually looking at the spec, I don\u0027t see a minimum value defined.  So we probably shouldn\u0027t say \"the minimum keep alive value\" - that\u0027s one that we\u0027ve defined internally within SPDK, but it\u0027s not part of the spec.\n\nI\u0027d be curious how we settled on 10 seconds for this.  I don\u0027t see any reason why we shouldn\u0027t let users pick something even smaller if they want.",
