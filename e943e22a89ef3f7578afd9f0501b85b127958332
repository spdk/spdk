      "message": "Thank you, Dong.\n\nI noticed that type of number of base bdevs are corrupted.\nstruct raid_bdev_config uses uint8_t but struct raid_bdev uses uint16_t.\n\nI think we should insert a patch to unify the type before this patch, and uint8_t will be enough because more than 255 base devices is unlikely. Will you share your thought?\n\nI will update the patch according to your feedback.",
