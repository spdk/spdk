      "message": "So removing the else means that someone can configure cryto with no programatic check or warning about the IPSEC requirement.  In the initial patch this seemed like a pretty strong requirement by reviewers - to be super user friendly and tolerant.  I don\u0027t think I saw another check anywhere, did you test configuring and building with and without IPSEC installed?",

      "message": "I guess I\u0027m not following.  With this patch, we don\u0027t install IPSEC now - we\u0027ll just always build and use what\u0027s in our submodule.  So there\u0027s no need to check if intel-ipsec-mb.h exists - we know it\u0027s in our submodule.\n\nWe already tell people to initialize their submodules (for DPDK) so I don\u0027t think we should check here if they initialized their submodules.  Or at least that would be something separate from this patch.",
