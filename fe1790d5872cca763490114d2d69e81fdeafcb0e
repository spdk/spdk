      "message": "Hi Changpeng,\n\nThank you for your comment.\n\nI developed and tested these complex code to get better understanding of T10DIF + IOV, and to remove any limitation of alignment and granularity.\n\nI agree with you that supporting multiple of (block size + metadata size) will be enough because I asked that idea in SPDK mailing list before. I remove these complex code in the next patch.\n\nWe will be able to support these complex use cases even if becoming necessary.\n\nI have had other critical tasks until tomorrow but I hope I will submit the next version in this week.\n\nThanks,\nShuhei",
