      "message": "This is where things get a little bit messy with the OCF bdev. I actually can remove the shared check by modifying the way that the OCF Makefile works (see next revision), but I don\u0027t think I can include the ENV in this dependency list. The reason for that is that the ocfenv library is only ever built as an archive. It is never a shared library so it doesn\u0027t fit into the SPDK_DEP_LIBS concept. I think that there is probably still work we can do to make the whole OCF build more SPDK friendly.",
