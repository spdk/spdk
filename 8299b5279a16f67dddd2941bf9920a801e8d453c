      "message": "I think you can pack this structure even better (in a separate commit obviously) by moving trid just after your new nvmf_icdoff field.\n\nI\u0027m not even sure the trid belongs in the \"hot data\" part of this structure.  I don\u0027t see anything touching the trid in the main I/O path.  But putting after nvmf_icdoff is good enough, and should save us a cacheline.  trid is 512 bytes, and since ns comes first, it basically ends up being the only field in the first cache line that actually gets used in the main I/O path.  Moving trid fixes that.",
