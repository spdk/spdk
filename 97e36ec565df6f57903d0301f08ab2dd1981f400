      "message": "I\u0027m concerned that an array of integers likely won\u0027t work for all of the types of limits we want to specify. I think we should define a new struct that contains a list of the limits and have the user pass that instead.\n\nI think a struct is a much clearer API as well - right now it isn\u0027t clear which limit is which in the array (I assume they\u0027re in the same order as the enum defined above?).",

      "message": "For this particular patch, a for loop over each limit type works. However, that won\u0027t continue working as soon as one type of limit doesn\u0027t apply to all I/O types (i.e. a read limit). Instead, I think inside this loop you\u0027ll want to write this as a switch statement on the bdev_io\u0027s type, and then handle each case individually.",
