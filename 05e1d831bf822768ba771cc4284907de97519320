      "message": "It looks like this will now store the full path in BlobFS, instead of just the portion of the filename after our mount point.  Is that right?\n\nIf so, I think we really should keep the current behavior and strip off the mount directory from the filenames stored in BlobFS.  Then a user can still use the BlobFS even if it\u0027s mounted at a different mount point.  These changes would also break (or drastically alter) using the FUSE module to view the files in a BlobFS.",
