      "message": "-e is the traceflag mask, but thanks for making me take a look at this, because I need to change it to 0xFFFF (Like it was before). I accidentally left off an F when transposing it.\n\nFYI this change completely gets rid of the NVMF_TEST_CORE_MASK variable. It was only used in the stub and was supposed to be equal to the maximum number of cores we would use in any of the NVMe-oF tests.",
