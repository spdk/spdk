      "message": "This needs to be described (...or fixed in vhost). How about the following:\n\nWindows Virtio drivers use indirect descriptors without negotiating their feature flag, which is explicitly forbidden by the Virtio 1.0 spec. \"(2.4.5.3.1 Driver Requirements: Indirect Descriptors) The driver MUST NOT set the VIRTQ_DESC_F_INDIRECT flag unless the VIRTIO_F_INDIRECT_DESC feature was negotiated.\". Violating this rule doesn\u0027t cause any issues for SPDK vhost, but triggers an assert, so we can only run Windows VMs with non-debug SPDK builds.",
