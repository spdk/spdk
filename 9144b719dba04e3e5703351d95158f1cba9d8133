      "message": "change all of these to just pass \u0026ns-\u003ebase, then you shouldn\u0027t have to change as much code (i.e. bdev_nvme_write first parameter won\u0027t have to be changed)\n\nthe only caveat is that the dif_check_flags are currently stored in the bdev structure, which you now can\u0027t get to via the base structure, so I think you should create a new patch, before this one, that copies the dif_check_flags value to a new member in the nvme_bdev_ns structure, and change the current usages to use this new field\n\nthen this patch will shrink considerably",
