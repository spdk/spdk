      "message": "General question on the OCF API here.\nFreeing the cleaner_priv here implies that cleaner stop (vbdev_ocf_ctx_cleaner_stop()) is called before cleaner queue stop (cleaner_queue_stop()).\nOtherwise we would crash when accessing cleaner_priv in vbdev_ocf_ctx_cleaner_stop().\n\nIt just seems backwards to first stop cleaner, and then stop its queue. Especially since init path is other way around.\nHave we confirmed this works like that ?",
