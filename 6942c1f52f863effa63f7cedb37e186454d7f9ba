It\u0027s not a lot, but the commit message doesn\u0027t mention anything about it, so we should either update the commit message, or add a separate patch (likely just before this one).  Normally we would want to separate out the nvme_spec.h Get LBA Status changes from the NVMf code changes, so I\u0027d vote for the former (separate patch).\n\nGood catch though Jacek - I hadn\u0027t even looked at the new OACS values in 1.4 to see this new one.",
