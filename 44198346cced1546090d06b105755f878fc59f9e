      "message": "I was going to say check for -EINVAL here, but unfortunately this would return -ENOMEM when the io flags are invalid.\n\nThat\u0027s really unfortunate.  It\u0027s actually an existing bug (since the same problem was there before your patch.)\n\nCould you add a patch before this one that fixes this issue?  We should do the io_flags check in each of the functions that call _nvme_ns_cmd_rw(), not in _nvme_ns_cmd_rw() itself.\n\nThen here, you can confirm that rc \u003d\u003d -EINVAL.",
