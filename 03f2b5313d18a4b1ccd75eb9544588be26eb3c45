You can this function is used to return the subsystem with during constructing the admin qpair.\n\nThis is used in constructing the admin qpair, we need to make sure that requested subsystem of the qpair is in active state. If the subsystem is not active (may be inactiving or pause), we should not let the qpair connects, then we can prevent the further issue.",

      "message": "I am with Changpeng on this one. We call spdk_nvmf_tgt_find _subsystem all over the place. Like when we try to delete a subsystem, when we add and remove namespaces, when we add and remove hosts. I think we should be able to do all of those things without a paused subsystem. This would require a subsystem to be active to do any of those.",

      "message": "Hi Seth,\nExcept active, there is other states like pausing, can you make sure that in all the state, it can work well? At least, this code actually can present this. It means that if the subsystem is not active, we will not create the related connection.",
