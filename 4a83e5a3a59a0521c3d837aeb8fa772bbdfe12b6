      "message": "This function seems to create some opal bdevs and then immediately delete them, multiple times.  But that is not really part of setting up the test environment for the bdevio/bdevperf test runs.\n\nI think this should look more like:\n\nfunction test_opal_cmds() {\n  # put your create/delete combinations here for testing various opal cmd\n}\n\nfunction setup_test_environment() {\n  # only put RPCs here that are needed to run bdevio and bdeverf\n}\n\nthen call test_opal_cmds immediately after opal_init",
