      "message": "You may already use it, but there is a really cool tool for looking at struct packing called \u0027pahole\u0027 - it\u0027s in the \u0027dwarves\u0027 package on Fedora. \n\nLooking at the output of that tool shows that the optimal packing would actually be to moved the uint16_t next to the uint32_t, and put all of the pointers after that. That will only leave a single 2 byte hole in the structure.",
