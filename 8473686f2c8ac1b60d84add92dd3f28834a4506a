Never should it be the case that\nenough writes occured in create/delete, but blobs are not\nin the expected state.\nWhen such bug would be introduced, it could be covered up\nby spdk_bs_unload() cleanly closing up the blobstore.\"\n\nWould like me to change this comment to following ?\n\"Do not shut down cleanly. After snapshot deletion, changes to both blobs should be persisted already.\"",
