      "message": "The ctrlr_bdev.c modifications for Read and Write look OK, but it doesn\u0027t look like the iovcnt !\u003d 1 case is handled for any of the other paths that touch data.  Any non-Read/Write command using req-\u003edata is going to be broken if the request is larger than io_unit_size, since the data won\u0027t be contiguous.\n\nThis is probably OK in practice, since other commands will normally be using small buffers (\u003c\u003d 4096 bytes), but it would be good to add some helper functions to fill out the iov-based buffers and get rid of all users of req-\u003edata.",
