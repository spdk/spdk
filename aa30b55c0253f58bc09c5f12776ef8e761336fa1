      "message": "Is it possible for spdk_thread_poll() to return \u003c0 now? Looking over the code in spdk_thread_poll(), I actually think it isn\u0027t possible anymore. Further, if spdk_thread_poll() detected an unrecoverable error, I think it should just spdk_thread_exit() itself rather than returning an error. Can we just change this to an assert that rc \u003e\u003d 0?",
