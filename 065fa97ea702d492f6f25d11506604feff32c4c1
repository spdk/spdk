      "message": "Hi Darek,\n\nCould you rework this patch so that the entire contents of this function are not both moved and modified?  It makes the patch a lot bigger and more difficult to review.\n\nEven things like taking the struct timespec out of the ctx object and making it a local variable can be done in a separate patch.\n\nAnything you can do to reduce the size of diffs (in general - not just this patch) makes it much easier on reviewers and will get patches reviewed and committed much more quickly.  It is much easier to review and comprehend a 30-40 line patch than a 150 line patch.  When the function moves like this, I need to check line-by-line what has changed since there is no diff available.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
