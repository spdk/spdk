      "message": "Which information specifically do you need? The tgt structure is passed into the accept function already and is accessible from the qpair via qpair-\u003etransport-\u003etgt in the new_qpair function. Can you get the information you need from the target structure?\n\nOr is it some sort of metadata about the target? For example, your application has some sort of global state that it stores around the target (equivalent or similar to the g_tgt_state concept in the in-tree spdk application). In that case it would be a little bit trickier to handle.\nIf it\u0027s the second case, I have a few questions to see if we can figure out how to avoid passing a new argument to the public API functions.\nIf you can\u0027t store global state, is the lifecycle of that information only valid from the time that you call accept to the time that you return? If so, can you derive that information from the target in new_qpair the same as you can in the wrapper function that calls accept?",

      "message": "Hi Seth, thanks for your comment. As you say, if it was just about getting the tgt pointer then the ctx argument would not be really necessary. In my case the context structure is holding a global state related to nvmf target: tgt pointer, trid, tgt opts, acceptor poller pointer and nvmf poll group pointer. Though the only thing which is used from this state in the new_qpair() is the poll group pointer. So if there was a way how to obtain all poll groups for given target, then I would not need the context parameter. I haven\u0027t found such a function in public api. Though even if it existed, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the right solution. It works only until you don\u0027t need any other information from tgt state to make the right decision about which poll group to schedule the new qpair to.\n\nRe using globals: Rust is not very good with globals but apart from that if we consider a general case of having multiple nvmf targets, each with its own poll groups, then this would turn into a global lookup table with two levels. First I would have to find a target that matches the tgt passed to new_qpair() and then select pg from the list of pgs. That sounds like a lot of work for something that can be solved by passing a context parameter.",

      "message": "Thanks for explaining more about your use case. Looking at the rest of the public API functions with callbacks, you have the opportunity to pass an arbitrary callback argument to them. I assume that you are using that field to pass the target context around when starting/stopping subsystems, etc.\n\nThe API here was made before application based scheduling of qpairs was a thing, and I can\u0027t think of a better way to get around it.\n\nOne alternative to passing the context to the accept function, would be to add a pointer to the context inside of the target and pass it to the create structure in the spdk_nvmf_tgt_opts structure which would allow you to access that structure at any time. But I don\u0027t see any inherent benefits to that method over this one, since there is a cb_arg in the rest of the functions that you can use to pass that context.",
