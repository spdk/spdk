      "message": "(I know this patch is marked draft - but saw it related to another patch I was reviewing so I took a look).\n\nDeclaring parameters as arrays in C does not really work.  User could pass an array of size 1 here and compiler would not even warn about it I don\u0027t think.\n\nI like the idea of reducing the number of parameters here, but I think you need to still pass a num_luns parameter and just get rid of the lun_id_list.",
