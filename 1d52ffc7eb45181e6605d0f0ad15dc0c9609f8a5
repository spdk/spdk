      "message": "This comment is based on previous review done by me. Yet since then some feedback on main clone/snapshot series suggests that being read only for blob is enough of criteria to classify as snapshot. \n\nI see that at this time there is not much more done with snapshots (except setting to read only), so it works currently. Just feels awkward to have function spdk_blob_set_read_only() create a \"snapshot\" without creating clone - yet be seemingly unrelated.\n\nWonder what are other\u0027s opinion on this.",
