      "message": "So on the iscsi teset I sugested appending _iscsi to the test_completion so I\u0027d say the same thing here as they both say spdk_cli but I haven\u0027t gone back and looked to see how this is reported, if these are in iscsi and nvmf sections then obviously its not needed.\n\nAlso, what\u0027s the execution time on this one?  And, maybe we should consider just an spdk_client test that runs just a few commands against its various supported targets instead of adding longer tests per target.  I didn\u0027t compare coverage but I\u0027m guessing this is testing the client for than it is the target correct?",

      "message": "Hi Paul. Thanks for review. I fixed test_completion for iscsi test. This command only says that test was completed.\nThis fix is needed also in rbd.sh script. \nTiming_enter and timing_exit say more about test time.\nTests for spdkcli with iscsi take about 30 seconds. I think that we cannot tests all with one target as some machines don\u0027t support all features.",
