Since the rest of the data is being filled in randomly, the chances of any other command capsule being filled out properly are astronomically low. Take a write for example. It would be very unlikely for all of the LBA information and memory regions needed by that command to be filled out in a way that the drive should accept. We still print them out in case we get a positive completion on an unexpected opcode or some other time when we shouldn\u0027t.",
