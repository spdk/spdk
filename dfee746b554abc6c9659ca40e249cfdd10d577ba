      "message": "seems we could avoid duplicated code by just putting case AWAIT_PDU_READY just above case AWAIT_PDU_CH, and adding a check after pdu-\u003ech_valid_bytes +\u003d rc to set the recv_state to AWAIT_PDU_CH if ch_valid_bytes \u003e 0.  it means there are some times where you unnecessarily overwrite state AWAIT_PDU_CH with AWAIT_PDU_CH but it avoids 10 lines or so of code duplication",
