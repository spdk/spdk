      "message": "Should this explicitly call out that this patch also restricts spdk_bdev_unmap() to a single range?  I mean it\u0027s obviously implied since its now just an offset and bytes.  But the way this is worded makes it sound like there is no downside to this patch.  (I still agree with the patch though.)",

This is saying if the response still thinks it is successful, check this particular completion and update the status. That results in us returning the first error reported in a completion.\n\nI could change it to report the last error seen too which would look like this:\n\nspdk_bdev_io_get_nvme_status(bdev_io, \u0026sc, \u0026sct);\nif (sct !\u003d SPDK_NVME_SCT_GENERIC || sc !\u003d SPDK_NVME_SC_SUCCESS) {\n    response-\u003estatus.sc \u003d sc;\n    response-\u003estatus.sct \u003d sct;\n}\n\nI\u0027m not sure which behavior is the better one to have.
