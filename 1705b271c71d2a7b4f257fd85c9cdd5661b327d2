We probably would like to avoid having disabling any tests by accident - on current Jenkins setup.",

      "message": "Yes, this will change default value and let autotest.sh to run only explicitly specified tests. This would make configuring autotest easier and relieve us from updating config file every time when new functionality is added. But setting all values to 0 makes it necessary to update all existing config files so for now giving option to chose is safer.",
