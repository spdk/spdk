      "message": "Why do you need to replace \"//\" with \"/\" here, but not potentially everywhere? I think to make this really work, we need to write a utility function to \"normalize\" all of the filenames. This function should:\n\n1) Remove repeated \"/\" characters.\n2) Resolve \"/./\" and \"/../\" sequences.\n3) Make sure all paths start with \"/\"\n\nOnce we have that, we should call it on any fname we\u0027re passed before doing any blobstore operations.",

      "message": "In our C style guidelines we do require that all variables are declared at the top of a scope. However, for C++ I think we should code with a different style, especially now that the \u0027auto\u0027 keyword is available (since 2011). For instance, you can write line 431 as:\n\nauto full_path \u003d spdk_file_get_name(file);\n\nWithout ever declaring it at the top, that will work. The \u0027auto\u0027 keyword will deduce the correct type.",
