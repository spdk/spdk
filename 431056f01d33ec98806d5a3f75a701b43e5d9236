      "message": "I have to admit that I\u0027m not a huge fan of adding this prefix idea as part of adding the RPC.  Shouldn\u0027t that be separate patches?\n\nI\u0027m thinking about cases where user specifies a prefix different than the bdev name.  Then later what if that prefix matches a different bdev name?  I know that\u0027s a corner case, but I don\u0027t think that gets handled here.\n\nI\u0027d really prefer to rip out the prefix stuff - let\u0027s just get the RPC functionality in that matches what the INI-based config file does now.  Or is there some use case specific to RPC that requires this prefix?",
