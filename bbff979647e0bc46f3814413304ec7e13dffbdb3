Since \"name\" is an xattr set by owner of the blob (it might as well not exist at all).\nSince lvol is the one setting this xattr, lvol layer should retrive it using spdk_blob_get_xattr_value().\n\nI realize you\u0027ve done this because vbdev_lvol_dump_info_json is not asynchronous. But changing that might be better for all the use cases.",
