      "message": "env_dpdk is kind of special library and it probably shouldn\u0027t be explicitly included like that. \n\nTo describe it briefly:\nSPDK provides an abstraction layer for managing hugepage memory and PCI devices. The default implementation that SPDK ships with is based on DPDK (all rte_* functions) and it\u0027s located in env_dpdk dir, but it\u0027s possible to specify a different env implementation during compilation. In such case, the env_dpdk dir is completely omitted in the build process.\n\nI can see this is partially handled in this makefile (line #41).\n\nAs the long term solution, I\u0027d suggest adding ENV_LIBS as a direct dependency of APP in spdk.unittest.mk. This should work no matter which env implementation is used.",
