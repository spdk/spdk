      "message": "I see you are doing this free(w), because on every case the array is begun before knowing if device is there. Yet, the overall design for json_rpc is that when response begins, it always has to end with spdk_jsonrpc_end_result().\n\nMy previous comment on providing ENODEV, was on get_bdevs or get_lvol_stores where the check if a device exists is done beforehand.\n\nWe can do two things here:\n- Skip providing ENODEV and just give empty array (as in previous patch set)\n- Add check for vbdev_ocf_get_by_name() and vbdev_ocf_get_base_by_name() before iterating. This will cause us to iterate 2-3 times over g_ocf_vbdev_head\n\nI haven\u0027t considered aspect of json response, sorry.\n\nAnother, would be to provide getters for cache and core directly in the API - convoluted since there can be multiple of the same cache structures belonging to multiple vbdev_ocfs :/",
