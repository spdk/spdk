      "message": "The io_queue_size is limited by the driver to the actual supported MQES, but io_queue_requests is not, so this will always allocate a full 65535 requests for each queue.  This is probably OK for perf, but it will mean we allocate 65535 * 256 bytes per queue, which will require a 16 MB spdk_dma_malloc() allocation per queue (we allocate all of the requests for a queue in a single contiguous buffer).",
