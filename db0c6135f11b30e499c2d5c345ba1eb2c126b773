      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should assert SCSI_STATUS_GOOD here.  At this point, the IO isn\u0027t actually completed yet.  SCSI_STATUS_GOOD \u003d\u003d 0x00, and we memset the task to 0\u0027s which is why this assert passes.\n\nIt would probably be better to initialize status to something invalid (0xFF?) and assert here that it is still invalid - meaning the SCSI layer didn\u0027t set it yet.  Then assert that status \u003d\u003d SCSI_STATUS_GOOD after you flush the IO.\n\nOther tests in this file already do this check, so this is just another case of that.  But now that you have the flush functionality in place, it would be better to fix these asserts I think.  Maybe as part of a separate patch before this one - that fixes the existing STATUS_GOOD asserts when the IO is pending?",

Because this task status is actually set by SCSI layer.\n\nCurrently on each IO that is submitted to bdev layer (no completion yet), return code is SPDK_SCSI_TASK_PENDING with status set to SPDK_SCSI_STATUS_GOOD. \n\n\nI went ahead and changed this behavior, so that SPDK_SCSI_STATUS_GOOD is set only on callback from bdev.\nhttps://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/spdk/spdk/+/417708/\n\nI\u0027ve added patch to initialize task with fields set to 0xFF to verify this and other variables actually changing. https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/spdk/spdk/+/417686/",
