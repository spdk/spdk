      "message": "Open Channel SSD (OCSSD) support has a feature where a namespace can be split into multiple bdevs - but capacity changes aren\u0027t going to happen on OCSSDs, and even if they did, it would be handled differently than the code you have here\n\nso let\u0027s just add a \u0026\u0026 ns-\u003etype \u003d\u003d NVME_BDEV_NS_STANDARD, which will ensure this code only gets executed for \u0027standard\u0027 controllers\n\nthen also remove the TAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE - in the standard case, there is only ever one bdev per ns, so you can just do TAILQ_FIRST() instead - I think that makes the code more clear",
