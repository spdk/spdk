      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is right.  Previous behavior would collect the value of poller-\u003efn(poller-\u003earg).\n\nSame for the timer poller below.\n\nMaybe you do something like:\n\naggregate_rc \u003d 0;\nif (poller) {\n  aggregate_rc \u003d poller-\u003efn(poller-\u003earg);\n}\nif (timer_poller) {\n  timer_rc \u003d poller-\u003efn(poller-\u003earg);\n  if (timer_rc \u003e aggregate_rc) {\n    aggregate_rc \u003d timer_rc;\n  }\n}\n\nThere\u0027s no perfect way to do it, but this would be fine for now.  I think once you\u0027re done with all of the thread refactoring, we\u0027ll want to move the stats from the reactor to the thread anyways - we\u0027ll need that to be able to do the scheduling.",
