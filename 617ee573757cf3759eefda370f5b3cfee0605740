      "message": "In this case, the third parameter is the block size.\n\nI see all of the tests pass 1024 which is really very non-standard.  Block sizes are almost always either 512 or 4096.  I think it would be better for the lvol tests to not specify the block sizes at all (it is an optional parameter).  So just remove the aio_cz parameter (is \"cz\" an abbreviation for the Polish word for \"size\" or was this just a typo?)\n\nOf course I have no idea why we show 8192 in the example in doc/bdev.md - we should change that too.  :)",
