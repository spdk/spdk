      "message": "Hi Xiaodong,\n\nThis Makefile is duplicating some targets from spdk.app.mk.  It results in make warnings when trace_porter is built.\n\nYou should be able to remove a lot of this, and just use spdk.app.mk instead.  Normally spdk.app.mk is included at the end of the Makefile, so then remove spdk.deps.mk.  See app/iscsi_tgt/Makefile for example.\n\n-Jim",
