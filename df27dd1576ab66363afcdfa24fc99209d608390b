If you imagine the case where you are registering a large buffer that is a subset of a region that was previously registered, you\u0027ll end up inserting the NOTIFY_START flag in the middle of the region.\n\nI\u0027m totally fine with putting a check up top that for the first segment being registered, the notify start flag is set if the ref count is greater than 0 that blocks this problem case, if you want.",
