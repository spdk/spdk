      "message": "We don\u0027t want to get swapped out.  Making this a spinlock ensures it doesn\u0027t get swapped out, if the lock is already held by another thread.\n\nIn practice, even with the mutex, a thread that is blocked won\u0027t sleep if it sees that the thread holding the lock is currently running, since it\u0027s likely the mutex will be released soon.\n\nSo I think using a spinlock here is the right thing to do.  I know we use mutexes elsewhere in SPDK but those should probably be switched to spinlocks.  That\u0027s what DPDK primarily uses.",
