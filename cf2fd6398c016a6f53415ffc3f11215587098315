      "message": "The code here all looks fine and I like this idea of separating connection establishment from start/pause of I/O processing.  I also understand that we do not want to change the names \"new_device\" and \"destroy_device\" in the DPDK code.\n\nBut to make this more clear, maybe we should change our SPDK function names from \"new_device\" and \"destroy_device\" to \"start_device\" and \"stop_device\"?  Because that\u0027s really what these functions do now - they don\u0027t actually create or destroy any devices, they just start or stop a device that already exists.  It also matches the error messages in \"destroy_device\" for example.",
