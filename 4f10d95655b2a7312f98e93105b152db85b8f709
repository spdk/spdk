      "message": "Could you create one patch that just adds this create_vbdev_dev() function?  With no functionality changes.  Then a second patch that fixes the leak.\n\nIt makes it way easier to review.  With the patch like this I have to scroll up and down to check what was changed as the code was moved.\n\nIn general, please always do separate patches that move code, and then a follow up patch that changes the code.",
