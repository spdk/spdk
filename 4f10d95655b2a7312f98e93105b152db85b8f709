      "message": "Could you create one patch that just adds this create_vbdev_dev() function?  With no functionality changes.  Then a second patch that fixes the leak.\n\nIt makes it way easier to review.  With the patch like this I have to scroll up and down to check what was changed as the code was moved.\n\nIn general, please always do separate patches that move code, and then a follow up patch that changes the code.",

      "message": "the leak is fixed in the refactor, it\u0027s no longer exposed as it was in the look that allocated the device stuct.  All that\u0027s done here is movement of the per device \u0027stuff\u0027 into the create_vbdev_dev() function and then in the driver_init function I call it in a loop.\n\nDoes that help? I\u0027ll update the commit msg too",
