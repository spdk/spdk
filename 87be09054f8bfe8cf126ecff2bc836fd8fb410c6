      "message": "As per Ben\u0027s feedback, it looks like this patch will require major change or be abandoned for another.\nThis you try to resolve later in https://review.gerrithub.io/c/spdk/spdk/+/473426/, but that does not look like right solution either.\n\nWhen nvme_io_msg_ctrlr_detach() is called and there are still some registered io_producers, each of those need to be called and allowed to clean up after itself. This implies that each registered io_producer needs to pass its own callback.\n\nThus making refcnt not sufficient to track registered io_producers. Keeping a structure as is right now, but adding callback to perform spdk_nvme_cuse_unregister() for CUSE would help resolve the issue 1033.",
