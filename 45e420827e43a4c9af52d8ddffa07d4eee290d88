      "message": "You picked a good example.  :)\n\nWe often refer to this tool as \"nvme perf\".  When using it from a built repo, it\u0027s pretty obvious since it\u0027s in the examples/nvme/perf directory.  But I think if we install it, we may literally want the name \"nvmeperf\" instead of \"perf\".\n\nSo maybe we provide a way for these Makefiles to specify an INSTALL_APPNAME.  Here we could set that to \"nvmeperf\".  We also have multiple hello_world examples which would also necessitate something like INSTALL_APPNAME.",

      "message": "The first arg is the source object that was built which is named just $APP -- not spdk_example_$APP.   Thus the invocation I wrote copies -and- renames $APP such that it is prepended with \"spdk_example\" once placed in $DESTDIR/$bindir.   The DPDK folks employ the same naming convention for their examples.",
