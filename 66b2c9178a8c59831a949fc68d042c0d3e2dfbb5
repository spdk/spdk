      "message": "These lba arrays end up getting DMA\u0027d to the device, so they need to be allocated by spdk_dma_malloc. The comments should say that.\n\nThat\u0027s aside from the fact that doing vectored I/O only at chunk granularity is mostly useless (except for reset). The valuable operations are all gathering data at sub-chunk granularity into a new chunk. But that\u0027s a spec issue - not a problem with what you\u0027ve done here.",
