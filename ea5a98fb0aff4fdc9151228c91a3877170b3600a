There might be cases where the user has some external repositories and can install those packages just fine - why do we care?\n\nIt\u0027s really annoying when you know what you\u0027re doing and want to run some script, but the script knows better and doesn\u0027t allow you to do that, forcing you to manually remove all those error checks by editing the file.",
