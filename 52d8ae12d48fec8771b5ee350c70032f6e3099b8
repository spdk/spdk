      "message": "Once we simplify event_ctx down to just a pointer, then in the case where queued \u003d true this function does very little. It\u0027s just event_qpair-\u003eevt \u003d evt;\n\nI think that means we could eliminate this function and instead just inline the code into the two places where it\u0027s called below. That cleans up this queued parameter because the particulars of the queue handling are specific to where it is being called from.",
