      "message": "I still do not know why we need two separate IO rpc types.  Xiaodong - could you give an example?\n\nI don\u0027t see where NVME_IO_CMD would get processed in the next file.  It looks like the code right now only handles NVME_IO_RAW_CMD.\n\nI know that the Linux kernel has IOCTL_SUBMIT_IO and IOCTL_IO_CMD - but I find that really confusing.  We should avoid multiple IO RPCs if we can avoid it I think.  But please provide the example since there\u0027s probably something I\u0027m not understanding.\n\nThanks.",
