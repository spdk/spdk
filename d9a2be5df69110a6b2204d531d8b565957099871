      "message": "Is there a better name than et_sz?\n\nIf I\u0027m reading this correctly, et_sz represents the size required for the extent table, based on the new size.  While num_extent_pages represents the current size of the extent table?\n\nI know this function already uses \"sz\" and \"num_clusters\" which is just as confusing.  :)  But I\u0027d say in this case let\u0027s pick names that are a bit more descriptive to make this easier to review.  Maybe new_et_sz and current_et_sz?",

      "message": "just curious - you used \"extent_pages_array_size\" in the mut_data structure, but here you\u0027re using et_sz which I think means extent_table_size.  Should we make those names consistent?  That could just mean calling this variable epa_sz instead of et_sz.",
