It was always possible to connect e.g. a QEMU vhost-user-scsi driver to a vhost-blk device and the only way to detect error would be feature flags incompatibility or different I/O request structure.\n\nThis backend pointer is only maintained internally in SPDK. It\u0027s set on vdev initialization and not changed anywhere later.",
