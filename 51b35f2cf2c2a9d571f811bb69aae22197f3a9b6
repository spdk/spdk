This IP address is already bound to the socket and hence as you said if it is ipv4 it must be \"0.0.0.0 and if it is ipv6 it must be [::].\nHow about is the following?\n\nif (strcasecmp(host, \"[::]\") \u003d\u003d 0\n    || strcasecmp(host, \"0.0.0.0\") \u003d\u003d 0) {\n  if (spdk_sock_is_ipv6(conn-\u003esock)) {\n    snprintf(buf, sizeof buf, \"[%s]\", conn-\u003etarget_addr);\n    host \u003d buf;\n  } else if (spdk_sock_is_ipv4(conn-\u003esock)) {\n    snprintf(buf, sizeof buf, \"%s\", conn-\u003etarget_addr);\n    host \u003d buf;\n  } else {\n    continue;\n  }\n}    \n\nI will include your feedback and submit again after Nov 13th due to the connectivity issue and please wait for that.
