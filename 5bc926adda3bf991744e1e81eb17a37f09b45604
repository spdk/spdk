      "message": "Hi Isaac,\n\nWould just \"ticks_rate\" work here?  ticks_us_rate is probably fine, but am thinking just putting the ticks per second rate here avoids a conversion in SPDK.  Clients may need to do extra conversions anyways if they want to show data in milliseconds for example.\n\nIdeally, we would have a system-level RPC to get the tsc rate for the application, but having this one here too is not a showstopper for me.\n\n-Jim",
