      "message": "I don\u0027t believe there is ever a functional case where we can\u0027t get the sq_paddr by calling spdk_vtophys on sq_vaddr. So I think the physical addresses can be dropped from the function. Were you thinking there was some scenario where you\u0027d use memory that wasn\u0027t registered with SPDK? I think that could lead to a lot of problems.",
