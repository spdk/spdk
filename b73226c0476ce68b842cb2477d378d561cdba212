It will accept decimal, octal, or hex numbers at once.\n\n$ man strtol\n If base is zero or 16, the string may then include a \"0x\" or \"0X\" pre‚Äê\n fix, and the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken as 10 (decimal) unless  the\n next character is \u00270\u0027, in which case it is taken as 8 (octal).\n\nI believe this would match the original behavior - before spdk_strtol was introduced.",
