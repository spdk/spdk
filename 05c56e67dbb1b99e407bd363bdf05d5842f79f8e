      "message": "I like the patch to change the names.  :-)\n\nBut how about instead we name this nvme_ctrlr_populate_namespaces?  Currently we create all of the namespace objects up front, based on num_ns, and use the active flag to denote which ones are active at any time.  I don\u0027t see a reason to change that (although I see that it does get changed in a later patch).\n\nTaking that approach should eliminate or at least greatly simplify that later patch.",
