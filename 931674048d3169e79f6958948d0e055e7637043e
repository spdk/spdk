      "message": "Previously the connection was not exposed as part of the public API. Now it is, but only in a roundabout way via a request. What do you envision is the use case for this callback? If the user needs to know about individual connections, should they become a first class citizen in the API with a notification callback called as part of spdk_jsonrpc_server_poll?",
