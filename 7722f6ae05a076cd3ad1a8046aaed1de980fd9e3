      "message": "I mainly chose \"start\" because this function prepares the raid_io to get sent to the member disk (mostly just setting the raid_io-\u003ech).  If raid_bdev_submit_rw_request() fails, it may be because we ran out of bdev_io structures, and need to resubmit.  So in that case we will call raid_bdev_submit_rw_request again after we get the callback from the bdev layer that a bdev_io is available.\n\nIf I update the comments do you think it would make the choice of this name less odd?",
