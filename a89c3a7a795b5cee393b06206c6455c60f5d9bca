If the user asks for single file segments and the DPDK underneath doesn\u0027t support them, we should print a message and exit - and that\u0027s what DPDK does already. Silently not using single file segments just masks the problem. They *are* required in some cases.\n\nInstead, we might want to describe --single-file-segments availability in doc/applications.md.",

I do not think that this patch is breaking anything. If we do not want to support such feature, all the code related this in SPDK should be removed.",
