      "message": "This line aims to defer destruction until the qp is drained.\n\nAs you said in comment, some driver/hardware doesn\u0027t post back the failed wr successfully. Under that circumstance, qp will not be drained forever. So this line should be removed and nvmf_rdma_destroy_drained_qpair will destroy qp to release its resources.\n\nBut I think removing this line causes a potential problem. There\u0027s a possibility that ibv_poll_cq polls the wr of this destoryed qp after nvmf_rdma_destroy_drained_qpair\u0027s execution. If the possibility exists, ibv_poll_cq path will aceess a destroyed qp.",
