      "message": "I think it would be good to keep.\nIt\u0027s kind of an edge case, but someone could fill name right up to the last byte without including a NULL terminator. In that case, the snprintf call would catch it and replace the last character of their target with a NULL byte. Then subsequent attempts to find the target by name would fail because the stored value would not be the same as the (malformed) requested name.\nAlthough maybe I should use strnlen to avoid buffer overflow when checking the length?",
