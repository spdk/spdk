      "message": "I like this description. You covered the topics in a really understandable way. The only question I still have at the end of it was how can I know if my device is being bottlenecked by garbage collection. However, I can see how the answer to that question may be outside of the scope of this document.\nIs there a specific rule of thumb that users can use to determine how to manage their workloads to see maximum random write performance based on the factory over-provisioning of their device? \nI imagine another way for the user to check would be to start a random write benchmark on a small portion of the disk (i.e. by reserving a large portion of the disk in software)and then increase the portion of the disk to which they are writing until they see a performance dip.\nDo we currently have a best known method?",
