I think that will keep the API a lot more simple and not have to think too much about the difference between \"io_get_buf\" and \"io_get_sized_buf\".\n\nBut I\u0027d still like to think about avoiding this altogether by putting the virtio unmap bytes in the virtio_req which is allocated out of the bdev_io memory.",
