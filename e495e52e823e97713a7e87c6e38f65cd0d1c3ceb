      "message": "I think this just shifts the problem elsewhere. If all of the descriptors get closed before this callback executes, the bdev could have been freed. That likely means whatever desc-\u003eremove_ctx was pointing at is also invalid, and the user isn\u0027t expecting to get notified of a removal after having closed the descriptor.\n\nIn spdk_bdev_close(), if desc-\u003eremove_scheduled is true, don\u0027t remove it from the open_descs list or free the memory. Instead, mark a new flag on the descriptor named \u0027closed\u0027 equal to true. Then when _remove_notify actually executes, set desc-\u003eremove_scheduled back to false and if closed is true, call spdk_bdev_close().\n\nI think that will work out all of the race conditions.",

      "message": "This is a great catch.  Ben and I just chatted on this.  I agree if the user has closed the descriptor, we *must* not notify the user of a hotplug.\n\nBut I think we should still remove the descriptor from the list here - just don\u0027t free it.  Add and set the \"closed\" flag like Ben suggested.  Then in _remove_notify:\n\nif (desc-\u003eclosed) {\n  free(desc);\nelse {\n  desc-\u003eremove_cb(desc-\u003eremove_ctx);\n}",
