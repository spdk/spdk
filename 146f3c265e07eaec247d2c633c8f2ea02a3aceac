      "message": "Vitaliy, I see some functional changes here despite the patch being named just \"reorder management functions\". Those should be done in separate patches, with separate explanations.\n\nI can see 3 different changes here:\n * stop_vbdev is now called outside of remove_base() \u003c- this looks like a good cleanup, remove_base() finally does what its name suggests and nothing else\n * stop_vbdev is now a separate asynchronous step in the unregister path \u003c- why?? Will it ever become asynchronous? Can\u0027t we just call it synchronously from unregister_finish()? This deserves a separate patch and a separate explanation.\n * some functions are reordered \u003c- that\u0027s fine, but not together with the above two changes. I\u0027m not able to diff changes inside stop_vbdev().",
