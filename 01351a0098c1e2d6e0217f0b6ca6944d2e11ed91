      "message": "Jim I added patch for io_device_register change, but I had to do it after this patch. The reason is that if I did it before this one I would free nvme_bdev_ctrlr in bdev_nvme_ctrlr_destruct function and then get this freed nvme_bdev_ctrlr in bdev_nvme_unregister_cb function and try to access it here: spdk_nvme_detach(nvme_bdev_ctrlr-\u003ectrlr) (please see the latest patch version).",
