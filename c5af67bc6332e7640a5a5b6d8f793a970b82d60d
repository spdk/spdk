      "message": "Hi Vitaliy,\n\nThis is a great catch.  Glad you found the fix rather than just \"make clean\" and \"make\" to work around the problem!\n\nUsing export here would work, but I think I would prefer a new spdk.env_unittests.mk file.  We really don\u0027t use \"export\" like this in the SPDK build system and am concerned it makes it not obvious enough how the ADDITIONAL_LIBS gets pulled in.\n\nI would be OK with one of two alternate approaches:\n\n1) Just add this ADDITIONAL_LIBS to each of the the three Makefiles under test/env.\n2) Add a new mk/spdk.env.unittest.mk which just adds this ADDITIONAL_LIBS line and includes spdk.unittest.mk.  Then change the three Makefiles under test/env to include this new .mk file instead.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",
