Then we know for sure that the sc was set to 0, and is not accidentally 0.\n\nThis goes for all of the unit tests below.  This is a key part of unit testing - we should *always* do this in unit tests, set the value to some failing value first, then when we check the value we know it was definitely set to that value.",
