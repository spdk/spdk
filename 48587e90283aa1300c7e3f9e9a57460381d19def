      "message": "Rather than setting a special global here, it would be nice if we could just call nvme_ctrlr_probe() on it, which would add it to the init_ctrlrs list.  We will have to change nvme_ctrlr_process_init() to handle a controller that is already in NVME_CTRLR_STATE_READY, but otherwise, everything should work as normal, and no special case will need to be added in nvme_init_controllers().\n\nWe also need to update any NVMe library users so that they are ready for a discovery controller in probe_cb. We need to add checks throughout all of the examples so that we don\u0027t try to do I/O to a discovery subsystem.",
