So putting the reason here will not leave any extra bits.\n\nI guess we could see which patch gets merged first and fix it then.  Maybe that\u0027s better since if you move it, someone else will ask why you didn\u0027t put the bits here instead.  But to avoid that you could push the patch and then add a GerritHub comment explaining why you put it there.",
