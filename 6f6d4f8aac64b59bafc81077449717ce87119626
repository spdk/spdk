      "message": "Hi Cunyin,\n\nIt would be better to either:\n\n1) just add declarations for these three functions, and keep the definitions at the end of the file, or\n2) make a separate patch that only moves these functions\n\nThis reduces the size of this patch and helps the reviewer.  When there is a major functionality change, plus functions are moved, the reviewer has to take extra time to see if any code was changed in those moved functions.\n\n-Jim",
