Instead, one of two could be done:\n1) Easy one - the strings differ by just the last additional \"-\" so keep 6 of them in new strings too.\n2) Better one - move part that generates script.log from Jenkins to autorun_post.py (@Karol thx for suggestion)",

For the time being, I am just going to fix the string to be what it is before since this change is changing different behavior, but I think that\u0027s a good forward looking solution.",
