      "message": "During this make step, vpp tries to install a version of openssl using debuginfo-install. This step fails because the version of the openssl development that we install earlier (line 48) conflicts with the version being installed through vpp. I was able to change openssl-devel to compat-openssl10-devel on my machine to make it work, but I am not 100% that doesn\u0027t break other things that depend on openssl-devel.
