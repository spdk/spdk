PATTERN [FILE]...\n\u003e Try \u0027grep --help\u0027 for more information.\n\nThis also shows why piping output can be sometimes misleading. You got a +1 from TP even though your command failed. Ideally we\u0027d use set -o pipefail here.\n\n\nI\u0027d move waitforblk directly into first connect loop. Waitforblk does exactly what you do (lsblk + grep) with timeout as well.",
