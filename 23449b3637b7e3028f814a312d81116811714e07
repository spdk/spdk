So if we have a case where:\n\nbuffer for section A and A+1 are in the cache\nfile-\u003elast \u003d A+1\nA and A+1 are flushed\nA+1 is completed\ncache_free_buffers() on this file\n  A+1 is freed\n  A is not freed since flush is still in progress, so present_mask !\u003d 0\nwith this patch, file-\u003elast points to invalid cache buffer\n\nWhat is the problem with always setting file-\u003elast \u003d NULL?",
