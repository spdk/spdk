      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is what Jim meant when he said to print it out as hex.  We probably want a hex dump of the full value up to value_len, something like what spdk_trace_dump() does.  We also shouldn\u0027t print out the data as a string directly, since it could contain control characters that will screw up the terminal (or worse) - a column that shows only valid ASCII in the hex dump should be enough, e.g.:\n\n  00000000: 68 69 0A 68 65 6C 6C 6F 0A 77 6F 72 6C 64 0A 62  hi.hello.world.b\n  00000010: 79 65 0A                                         ye.",
