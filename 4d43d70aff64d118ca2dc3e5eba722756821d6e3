      "message": "I think this is OK.  But I really don\u0027t like this part of just returning if nvme_ctrlr_identify_active_ns() fails.  But that issue was there before - not related to this patch.\n\nI think we should clean it up though.  Maybe we need to allocate the spdk_nvme_ns_list() when the controller is created.  Define a max number of namespaces that we support per controller (4096?).  Then allocate that memory up front - and the whole controller never is initialized if we can\u0027t allocate it.\n\nCould you look at that after this series is done?",
