      "message": "This won\u0027t really work.  What happens if there are two open file descriptors for a file?  It also assumes that a file was already opened, and just tries to close all files even if they weren\u0027t opened.  This kind of works but is a bit tacky.\n\nCan you describe the problem if there are still open files?  Is it the delete case - i.e. file is open, app deletes it, blobfs waits for last descriptor to close, but app shuts down without closing the file?",
