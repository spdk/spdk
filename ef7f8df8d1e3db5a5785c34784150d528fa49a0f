      "message": "Totally agree with you about that. Extending the `construct_vhost_scsi/blk_controller` RPC calls sounds good to me too. Maybe even better actually because we could then create multiple vhost controllers over multiple virtio-vhost-user devices from within the same SPDK vhost app instance.\n\nFYI, here is how I came to this solution:\n\nUnlike the AF_UNIX transport, where SPDK supports multiple connections on the same vhost controller, there is 1:1 correspondence among virtio-vhost-user devices and vhost controllers. This means that we can have a single master VM connected to one vhost controller via a virtio-vhost-user device. So, it was technically the same having a command-line parameter in the vhost app and extending the `construct_vhost_scsi/blk_controller` RPC calls. I just chose the first solution (maybe a little bit easier).\n\nSo, I will try to extend the RPC calls. Should I add a `--trtype` option like in case of `construct_virtio_dev` RPC call or directly pass the bdf address as the name of the controller? I am in favour of the first option because this makes it obvious to the end user that there are two available transports.",

      "message": "Having tried to implement both alternatives, it seems that autodetecting the trtype based on the vhost controller name is the easiest solution. Although inserting a `--trtype` option seems the most suitable choice, it is way more invasive as far as the code is concerned. If we want to insert `--trtype` option, we will have to add changes in the RPC calls (this implies changes in `vhost_rpc.c` and in the python scripts `rpc.py`, `vhost.py`) and in the configuration file parsing (`spdk_vhost_scsi/blk_controller_construct()`). In case of the RPC calls, we may also need to change the APIs just to pass over this extra option all the way through this function chain: `spdk_rpc_construct_vhost_scsi_controller`-\u003e`spdk_vhost_scsi_dev_construct`-\u003e`spdk_vhost_dev_register()`.\n\nI can do both . It\u0027s up to you to decide.",
