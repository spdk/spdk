      "message": "I think you should increment total_len and move the assert out of the if statement.  You set total_len on line 1072 and increment total_len on line 1084 even when rmw \u003d\u003d true, so I think you might as well increment total_len in all cases here too just for consistency.  Then you also get the total_len assert in the rmw\u003d\u003dtrue case too.",
