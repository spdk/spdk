      "message": "Yeah, this line is a little bit out of place, we always had to call make clean right before entering this script (see the old autobuild.sh line 138), so I just moved it into the script itself to:\n1. Make it more intuitive to run this script in isolation.\n2. make it so the top level test function was just calling a bunch of tests instead of a bunch of tests and make clean.\nI would have put it in a separate patch, but it would have been a one liner and there are a million changes in this series already.\n\nIf you still feel like it should be in a different patch, I can do that.",
