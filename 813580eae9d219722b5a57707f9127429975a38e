      "message": "No, I\u0027m not 100% positive but posting for review was a good way to check :)\n\nI moved the JSON code from here to vbdev_passthru_config_json() after examining other bdevs and testing using the next patch in this series.  From what I can tell this function is just for bdev specific methods, not for module methods.  In the next patch you can see where I added in use of the RPC to construct a PT.  In that code JSON is used to both save and load a config so it seems like these changes in this patch were needed.\n\nCan you or someone else confirm?",
