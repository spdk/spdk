      "message": "The transport \"opts_init\" function is used similarly to the spdk_nvmf_tgt_opts_init() function.  It\u0027s supposed to set the default values for those that aren\u0027t being set by the user (app). Also, the changes I made here were to provide backward compatibility with exiting apps. that still use the \"add listener\" functionality to create a transport.  However, this functionality should be deprecated and eventually removed in favor of using spdk_nvmf_transport_create() to create the transport.",
