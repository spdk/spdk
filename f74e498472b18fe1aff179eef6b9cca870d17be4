(Although one just below doesn\u0027t have the empty line.)\n\nI\u0027m not sure how much this matters in reality - i.e. compared to the first line of a git commit message.  I haven\u0027t found any examples in our tree that *don\u0027t* follow this, to see if the Doxygen documentation tries to put the whole paragraph in the function table.  But for consistency, I\u0027d suggest sticking with it.\n\nAlso - please capitalize \"Retrieve\".  :-)",
