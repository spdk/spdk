      "message": "We could create blobstores on devices with 512B block sizes even before these changes.  I think more accurately, this should say:\n\nBlobstore I/O operations are now based on io_units, instead of blobstore page size.  The io_unit size is now the same as the underlying block device\u0027s block size.  Logical volumes built on a block device with 512B block size can now be used as boot devices in QEMU.",
