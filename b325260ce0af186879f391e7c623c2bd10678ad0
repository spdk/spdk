      "message": "Hi Pawel,\n\nDo you think it would be OK if we just used period_us \u003d\u003d 0 to mean the default?  Usually a period of 0 means poll as often as possible, but I think for hotplug polling, that\u0027s not something you really want to do (and you can just select period_us \u003d 1 which is close enough).\n\nThen we don\u0027t need any of the int64 stuff and can just use uint64 across the board.\n\n-Jim",
