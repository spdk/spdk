      "message": "but we have to account for the md_descriptor header - so it won\u0027t be a full 4096 bytes for extent entries\n\nI\u0027d call that out here in the commit message.  I know we already talked about this limitation (it means we\u0027d waste almost have of the md page) but our calculations indicated that it won\u0027t really matter\n\nbut I guess the other question is how often are we doing extent page calculations?  do we ever have to do it in the main I/O path?  I think it\u0027s only needed when we are allocating clusters - so maybe a non-power-of-2 is OK\n\nAt some point I was concerned about the power-of-2 stuff here, but now I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s not really an issue at all.",
