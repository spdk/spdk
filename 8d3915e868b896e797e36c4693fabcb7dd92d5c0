      "message": "So I may have been a little rash in suggesting this route. It looks like this methodology is exporting both of them as virtio-blk disks, and support for describing virtio-scsi disks has not yet made its way fully to the libvirt-vagrant plugin. https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/pull/692\nSo after all that, I think you were right in the first place to use the qemu lines directly since the plugins aren\u0027t up to snuff. (Well VirtualBox may be, I didn\u0027t research it all the way to see if we could specify the drivers.)\n\nHow exactly are the virtio disks used in the vhost initiator tests? I tried looking at the tests, but couldn\u0027t find them.",
