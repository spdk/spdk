      "message": "I think this depends that when blobs A, B and C are all opened in parallel, that the completion callbacks will also be called in A, B and C order.  But that is not a guarantee by the API (even though it probably always happens like that now).  For example, opening those 3 blobs will result in 3 reads to disk and those reads may complete out of order.\n\nI think you need to keep a count instead.",
