      "message": "Thanks for pointing this out. I can\u0027t even do this check yet actually. I will need to fix the paths in qpair_init and poll_group_destroy before I can. It\u0027s possible that both of those paths are called out of tree. I can do the qpair_init paths after I remove the activating state, then the poll_group_destroy call will require a little more plumbing.\nOnce I fix all of the paths I will make this an assert.",
