      "message": "I\u0027m thinking about how to relate this to the extent_*_found flags in spdk_blob...\n\nI think it\u0027s more clear to have a third flag in spdk_blob called \"use_extent_table\" (rather than overloading one of the \"found\" flags).  That way when you\u0027re deciding whether to persist RLEs or tables, you just look at a flag that says \"use_extent_table\" which to me seems more clear than looking at \"extent_table_found\".  I also think that\u0027s more natural than setting one of the \"found\" flags to true even when they were both false.\n\nSo if we go that route, than I think the flag here should match the one in spdk_blob.  So \"use_extent_table\" would be the better name here.",
