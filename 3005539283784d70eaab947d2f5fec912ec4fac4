Historically vhost was a standalone SPDK application, but now it\u0027s just an SPDK module. We still have the vhost application (this file) for compatibility reasons, but vhost can be run e.g. through spdk_tgt app as well. I\u0027d still vote for removing `chosen_trans` and detecting the transport at runtime basing on the provided vhost device name.",
