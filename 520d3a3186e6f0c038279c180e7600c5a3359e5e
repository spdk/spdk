      "message": "Since false also means that the dif location is at the end of the metadata, couldn\u0027t returning false here send a bad signal to the caller?\nI guess any sane bdev module would always implement spdk_bdev_get_dif_location if it implemented spdk_bdev_get_dif_type, but it may be good to just take the bool as a second argument and use the return value to indicate if protection information is even supported. I think that for the other two functions this isn\u0027t a problem since returning 0 from them disables checking and is always safe.\nJust a thought. I don\u0027t think it would ever in practice be a problem, so you can take this comment or leave it.",
