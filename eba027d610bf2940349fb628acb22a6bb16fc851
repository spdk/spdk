      "message": "We don\u0027t normally give a name to nested unions like this, but if it does need a name (e.g. if we declare unions of this type elsewhere), it would be better to move the definition to the top level outside this struct and give it a nvmf_*-style name.\n\nIn this case, a union is probably not really worth the trouble; it saves a few bytes of memory at the cost of more complex/harder to understand code.  I would probably just move qpair and ctrlr to the outer struct and remove the union.",
