      "message": "I think that it is necessary to break the loop here. If we don\u0027t, spdk_bdev_reset() will be called again for the same base bdev and probably result in -ENOMEM again...\n\nThe same goes for the return at line 389, but there is an assert before that, so I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s needed or not. I noticed that there are many places in this code where there is some cleanup performed even after an assert fails, I assume that it is for NDEBUG builds. Is this a common practice in SPDK? Personally, I would just leave the assert(false) and remove lines 388 and 389.",
