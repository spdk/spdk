      "message": "Hi Shuhei,\n\nOne thing is not clear to me.  Previously, we would check separately for current_datain_offset \u003c transfer_len, and only do the abort in that case.  But here we always do the abort, even if current_data_offset \u003d\u003d transfer_len.\n\nIs the case that it was never valid for current_data_offset \u003d\u003d transfer_len?  Or now we may do an abort for size 0?\n\nI feel like maybe this should be split into multiple tasks - one to remove assumptions around current_data_offset could equal transfer_len, then another that changes the process to just do one abort subtask.\n\n-Jim",
