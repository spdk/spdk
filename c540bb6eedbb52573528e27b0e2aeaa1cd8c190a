      "message": "Can you find out what size of NVMe SSDs we have on the physical systems?  The metadata file for a 4TB SSD would be pretty big - 10GB or so.  Even a 1TB SSD will create a 2.5GB metadata file.  I\u0027m just wondering if we should pick something smaller here so we don\u0027t create such big /tmp files in the test.\n\nMaybe create an lvolstore, and don\u0027t unmap the clusters?  then just create a smaller logical volume on it to put the compression on.\n\nYou may want to add some extra timing_enter/exit calls in here too.  This test took 48 seconds which seems like a lot.",
