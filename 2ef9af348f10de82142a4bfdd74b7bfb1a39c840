I wrote it this way just to follow the convention of the other functions, but I had a conversation about something similar with Daniel and I think the logic behind it is that since we know it\u0027s not an error code from the if statement above, it\u0027s more clear to return 0 directly since we already know that\u0027s what the variable rc contains.",
