      "message": "For 0x3, it will get the g_clore as 0 (the 1st core). This is similar to the master_core logic, pick the first core here to get the related events from the assigned reactor.\n\nThe major purpose is that so that the event allocation is hard corded on core 0 and we need to get it properly from the assigned core. This fix will get the event from the first assigned core if there is a case multiple cores are set for this.\n\nBy the way, do we have the scenario to set a multiple cores mask for this usage?",
