      "message": "I\u0027m not following this commit message.  I don\u0027t see where _nvmf_rdma_qpair_disconnect \"sees that qpair-\u003egroup \u003d\u003d NULL\".  I see where _nvmf_rdma_qpair_disconnect calls spdk_nvmf_qpair_disconnect, and that spdk_nvmf_qpair_disconnect has an assert that deferences the qpair-\u003egroup.  But I don\u0027t see the other group checks.  Am I missing something?\n\nIn general though, this change seems non intuitive.  If we\u0027ve removed the qpair from the group\u0027s qpairs list, why should the qpair still point to the group?  I understand there may be a reason to do it to get the code to work, but I\u0027m concerned that this nuance will be lost on future readers of the code.",
