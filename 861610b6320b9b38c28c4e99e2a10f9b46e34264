      "message": "does this need to be a bit mask?\n\nI looked at the rest of this patch set, and I didn\u0027t seem like it was required.  The bit mask is very concise, but I think an array of bools would be much easier to read and understand.\n\nmost of the rest of this series looks good though, so I\u0027m adding my +1 - if you want to change it that\u0027s fine but I\u0027m also OK if you leave it as-is since it\u0027s only a few extra lines of code",
