      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that changing the return value of this function is necessary if you add the function I suggested and always call it in the transport before calling the user callback. I think it was just a mistake to wait to set the state to activating prior to calling that callback, so that\u0027s all you need to fix here.",

      "message": "Hi Ben,\n\nMy purpose is to differentiate the following two cases:\n\n1  Failure happens in the accepted core, the qpair state is Uninitialized.\n2  The failure happening to the schedule core via Round robin.\n\nAnd you can see our current code in spdk_nvmf_qpair_disconnect. We judge qpair is uninitialized, then we just return. However, even in uninitialized state, it may not fail. Since there is a window. So I need to set it to activating state early. \nIf we call set the state before cb_fn, we still can not differentiate such case. And set the state before cb_fn, cannot solve the window I mentioned.",
