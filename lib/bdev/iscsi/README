This is a very rough initial cut at an SPDK iSCSI initiator bdev module.  It
only performs operations (connect, login, read cap, read/write)
to a single hardcoded iSCSI LUN.  But this passes basic verify tests with
bdevperf and our SPDK iSCSI target.

To Do Items
===========
1) Use REPORT_LUNS to dynamically find all of the block devices attached to the
   iSCSI target node instead of hard-coding LUN 0.
2) Create RPCs.  Config file parameters are optional but focus should be on RPCs.
3) Use asynchronous polling for connect/login/disconnect.  Read/write is already
   using libiscsi event framework.
4) Choose initiator name as part of RPC configuration.  Currently this is hardcoded
   with g_initiator string.
5) Implement reset path.
6) Implement unmap path.
