      "message": "I think this flag probably needs to have a local copy on each channel (inside bs_channel) rather than on the blob as a whole to make this thread safe. This would be similar to the NVMe-oF target\u0027s subsystem state vs. sgroup state.  The flag would get set as part of the for_each_channel callback (_spdk_blob_io_sync) to make sure that the thread observes the correct frozen/unfrozen state without any locks.",
