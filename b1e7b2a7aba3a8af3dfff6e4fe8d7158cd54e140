      "message": "I agree that this new code is more precise.  Would you mind splitting these code changes out into a separate patch though?  This is part of the hyper-optimized NVMe code path - I don\u0027t *think* this should have any performance impacts (i.e. for benchmarks with 10M+ IO on one CPU core), but better to break out into a separate patch so we can easily bisect if needed.",
