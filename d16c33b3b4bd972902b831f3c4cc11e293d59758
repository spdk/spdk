      "message": "We might want to consider what happens if a second NS notice happens while one is already queued; the spec says:\n\n\u003e If the controller needs to report an event and there are no outstanding Asynchronous Event Request commands, the controller should send a single notification of that Asynchronous Event Type when an Asynchronous Event Request command is received.\n\nIn other words, we should not queue a second Notice event if there is already one queued.  It might be simpler to just have one AER queue per event type rather than a single queue for all events - that would let us avoid looking through a linked list to see if an existing event of the same type already exists.",
