      "message": "shortcut isn\u0027t the right word - maybe vhost stands for virtual host would be clearer. However, virtual host is so vague that I\u0027m not sure it helps explain much of anything anyway. Maybe instead we approach it like this:\n\nThe SPDK vhost target provides a local storage service as a process running on a local machine. It is capable of exposing virtualized block devices to QEMU instances or other arbitrary processes. These processes communicate with the vhost target using the [virtio protocol](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio), a standardized protocol for paravirtualized devices.",
