      "message": "So the comment here in lines 251-254 specifically applies to SC1117.\n\nSC2091 is not deprecated, we would just be choosing to not follow it.  That\u0027s fine, but we need to add a new SHCK_EXCLUDE line to list those kinds of SC values.\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if we can use +\u003d for these lines, i.e. SHCK_EXCLUDE +\u003d \",SC2091\".  A comment for each explicitly ignored error type would be helpful too - i.e:\n\n# Ignore SC2091: Remove surrounding $() to avoid executing output\nSHCK_EXCLUDE +\u003d \",SC2091\"\n\nAs we add more error types that we\u0027re going to exclude, just add one comment line, and append the new error type to this SHCK_EXCLUDE +\u003d line.\n\n(I thought I already made a comment about this at some point but must have been in a different review.)",
