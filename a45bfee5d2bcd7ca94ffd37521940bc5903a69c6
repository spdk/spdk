      "message": "So we have a 2 byte hole here between status and but, where we can stick another uint8_t named something like \"extended_status\".\n\nI really think we have to keep track of how the bdev_io status was obtained - i.e. just normal spdk_bdev_io_complete, or complete_nvme_status/complete_scsi_status.\n\nThen if the user calls get_nvme_status, on an I/O that wasn\u0027t completed with spdk_bdev_io_complete_nvme_status(), we know whether or not to use error.nvme.cdw0 for *cdw0.  If the I/O wasn\u0027t completed using spdk_bdev_io_complete_nvme_status(), then error.nvme.cdw0 is invalid.\n\nSo I think spdk_bdev_io_status_extended enum with values SPDK_BDEV_IO_STATUS_EXTENDED_NONE, STATUS_EXTENDED_NVME, STATUS_EXTENDED_SCSI.  You can initialize this new field to STATUS_EXTENDED_NONE in spdk_bdev_io_init() which gets called every time an spdk_bdev_io is allocated.\n\nThis would address Ben\u0027s comment on patch rev 4.",

      "message": "I can certainly make this change. However, two comments:\n\n- Can Ben comment on whether he agrees with that or have you guys talked? I just want to avoid another round of changes.\n- Wouldn\u0027t just setting the error.nvme.dw0 to 0 in spdk_bdev_io_init fix the issue? The NVMe spec says:\n\n---------\n1.7.5 reserved\nA keyword referring to bits, bytes, words, fields, and opcode values that are set-aside for future standardization. Their use and interpretation may be specified by future extensions to this or other specifications. A reserved bit, byte, word, field, or register shall be cleared to zero, or in accordance with a future extension to this specification. The recipient is not required to check reserved bits, bytes, words, or fields. Receipt of reserved coded values in defined fields in commands shall be reported as an error. Writing a reserved coded value into a controller register field produces undefined results.\n\n4.6 Completion Queue Entry\nAn entry in the Completion Queue is at least 16 bytes in size. Figure 26 describes the layout of the first 16 bytes of the Completion Queue Entry data structure. The contents of Dword 0 are command specific. If a command uses Dword 0, then the definition of this Dword is contained within the associated command definition. If a command does not use Dword 0, then the field is reserved. Dword 1 is reserved. Dword 2 is defined in Figure 27 and Dword 3 is defined in Figure 28. Any additional I/O Command Set defined in the future may use an alternate Completion Queue entry size or format.\n---------\n\nSo if we initialize it to 0 for every bdev_io and always pass the value to the NVMF layer, regardless of whether we actually set it via the spdk_bdev_io_complete_nvme_status, then we should be okay, no?",

      "message": "Jim and I talked it over and we\u0027d like to propose the following solution:\n\n1. Leave the cdw0 inside the error union as you have it.\n2. Set cdw0 to 0 inside spdk_bdev_io_init and _spdk_bdev_ch_retry_io()\n3. Always return cdw0 in spdk_bdev_io_get_nvme_status. It will be 0 if it isn\u0027t valid.\n\nThe key is also zeroing it in _spdk_bdev_ch_retry_io() - we were worried about bdev_ios getting re-used after a failure and then having junk in cdw0 even though they succeeded the second time.",
