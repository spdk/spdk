      "message": "I think you should initialize req.period to UINT64_MAX.  Then after you decode the object, if it is still set to UINT64_MAX, you know the caller did not specify it and you should fail the RPC.\n\nJust assuming 0 (to disable it) is probably OK, but using UINT64_MAX is more precise IMO.",
