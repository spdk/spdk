For example, the context setting words here are \"This case reflects the fact that...\". You can drop those words and the meaning of the comment is just as clear.\n\nAs a full example, I\u0027d write this comment as \"If an NVMe controller guarantees reading unallocated blocks returns zero, we can implement WRITE_ZEROES as an NVMe deallocate command.\"\n\nI bet you thought this was a code review. Surprise! It\u0027s a writing review.",
