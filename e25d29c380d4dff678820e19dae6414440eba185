      "message": "This will work since we only have one lbaf defined.  But instead of hardcoding 0 here, we should use nsdata-\u003eflbas.format instead.  For example, see similar logic for NVMe driver in nvme_ns_identify_update in lib/nvme/nvme_ns.c.\n\nI would also be OK with just directly using spdk_bdev_get_block_size(ns-\u003ebdev).",

      "message": "I was going to comment that maybe we shouldn\u0027t do this logic in case spdk_nvmf_bdev_ctrlr_identify_ns() returns an error.  But that function can never return an error.  Which makes me think that function should return void instead and then just return SPDK_NVMF_REQUEST_EXEC_STATUS_COMPLETE directly here.  You could do that in a separate cleanup patch before or after this one.",
