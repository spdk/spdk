      "message": "I think I don\u0027t understand how this is supposed to work.\n\nOnce bdev_ocf_delete is called, that means there is no more ocfWT?  So ocf_bdevs should basically be empty.\n\nBut comments on line 28, 38 and 46 are a bit unclear.  38 and 46 indicate that ocfWT should exist.\n\nI think it\u0027s important that you specifically check if ocfWT exists.  Just doing the diff is not enough - if the diff passes, it could mean that ocfWT did not exist in either, or it existed in both.  We want to only check for one case.",
