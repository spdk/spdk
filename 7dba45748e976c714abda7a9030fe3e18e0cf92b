      "message": "Hi Chunyang,\n\nHow do we know that the device really supports Opal?  And if it does, how do we know that the operations performed as expected?\n\nThis seems to execute the Opal code when the SSD supports Opal, but I\u0027m not sure that it\u0027s really testing to make sure what it is doing is correct.\n\nIs nvme_manage sufficient for the kinds of testing that we want to do to ensure that your opal code is correct?\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jim",

      "message": "Hi Jimï¼Œ\n\nThanks for your review. We will check opal support during the opal scan process. In this implementation, even if the device not supported, there will be no errors but just return with info log.\nThe errors will only be ejected if there is anything wrong in the process of cmd creation, cmd transformation and response parsing.\nFor now, nvme_manage is enough for configuration and testing. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nChunyang",
