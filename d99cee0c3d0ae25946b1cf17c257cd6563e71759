      "message": "Hi Shuhei,\n\nI am having trouble following these changes, but I think it is because the original code is also not clear.\n\nThis SPDK_GPT_BUFFER_SIZE is 32KB.  On 512-byte blockdevices, we must read 34 blocks or 17KB (LBA 0 - MBR, LBA 1 - GPT header, LBA 2-33 GPT partition entries).  On 4KB blockdevices, it is fewer blocks, but still roughly 17KB (I\u0027m not sure if MBR and GPT header are padded - haven\u0027t dug into this further yet).\n\nSo I think even with metadata-enabled devices, the SPDK_GPT_BUFFER_SIZE is sufficient.  If we are concerned about this, we could just increase SPDK_GPT_BUFFER_SIZE and reduce the complexity here.\n\nWhat do you think?  I\u0027m also curious if you\u0027ve been able to run tests on metadata-enabled devices with this patch?\n\n-Jim",
