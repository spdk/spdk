When blob is created using spdk_bs_create_blob_ext() and set to read_only at creation time, it won\u0027t be of any use to anyone as no data can be written to it.\n\nI think having separate function spdk_blob_set_read_only() makes sense. For snapshots later on, spdk_bs_md_create_blob_snapshot_opts() would internally call spdk_bs_create_blob_ext() and spdk_blob_set_read_only().",
