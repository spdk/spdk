      "message": "Its actually not consistent with *all* of them.  Look at lvol or split for example and lvol is pretty new.  It was originally \u0027name\u0027 before I saw any of this other code and in the process of figuring how where/how things worked to run the json_config test it just worked out that I used crypto_bdev_name instead because that\u0027s what I use in the params for the create method.\n\nIs this a showstopper for you? I can always go back through and get things working using \u0027name\u0027 consistently but IMHO it makes more sense to be descriptive within the bdev modules when they\u0027re not already 100% consistent across the bdev modules. Let me know, its not a problem to change.",
