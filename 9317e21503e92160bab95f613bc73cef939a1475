      "message": "I know this is going to seem pedantic, but I think I\u0027d prefer new_num_ep and current_num_ep.\n\nep_sz to me says \"size of the ep\".  et_sz would make sense (which I originally suggested), since \"size of the et\" naturally is related to the number of eps.  But I\u0027m thinking that \"num_ep\" is actually better, since you could have so many eps that you need more than one et, and \"size_of_all_et_put_together\" is really a bad name.  :-)",
