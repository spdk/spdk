      "message": "This is significantly harder to read than the current incarnation written in bash. And I love Python and am the biggest Python advocate on the development team, so the rest of the team probably thinks it is even less readable than I do.\n\nI have a few general questions:\n1) What advantages does this have over the version written in bash?\n2) Why does this need a 3k+ line framework? It looks like this test is just using a couple of simple utility functions out of that whole framework, which could easily be put in a single ~100 line file.",
