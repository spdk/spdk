      "message": "Hi Pawel Niedzwiecki,\n\nThis was my completely wrong feedback.\n\nI thought by mistake that \"rm -f\" is added by you in this patch.\nand these rm -f have own important purpose and you can do them separately.\n \nBut these important addition has been already merged.\n\nSo you don\u0027t have to remove -f.\n\nI apologize for confusing you much. I couldn\u0027t catch up the progress.\n\nPlease remove keep 3 \"rm -f\"",
