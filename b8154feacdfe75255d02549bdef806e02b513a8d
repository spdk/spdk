      "message": "I think this TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL should also be moved so that it is only done when there is a backing blob.\n\nThis TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL is only needed to make sure we aren\u0027t allocating tons of cluster-sized buffers for copy on write operations - we should only have one of those at a time.  But if we aren\u0027t doing a copy-on-write, there\u0027s no reason to wait.\n\nThat also means that line 1621 should check for parent_id !\u003d SPDK_BLOBID_INVALID.  If this blob doesn\u0027t have a parent ID, but some other blob does and has a copy-on-write operation in progress, we should still continue with the operation instead of queueing it.",
