      "message": "I\u0027d like to reword this paragraph slightly:\n\nspdk_put_io_channel() was designed to be called on the same thread that called spdk_get_io_channel().  spdk_put_io_channel() sends a message to its own thread, to allow the context to unwind before releasing the resources.  This had the side effect of allow an incorrect thread to call spdk_put_io_channel().  This patch will fix that.",
