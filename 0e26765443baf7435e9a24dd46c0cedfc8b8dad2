I imagine someone might not want our scripts to interfere that much with their packages.\n\nHow about we add an option to the script which would enable \"--allowerasing\" for yum/apt/pacman commands?\nYou\u0027d then have to:\na) add neccessary option in getopts\nb) create a helper variable for keeping otions, eg: PKG_MGR_OPTS\u003d\"-y\"\nc) modify it if needed to PKG_MGR_OPTS\u003d\"-y --allowerasing\"\nd) yum install ${PKG_MGR_OPTS} (lsit of packages)\n\nTomek. if you look here, what do you think?",
