      "message": "Ack your previous reply.  So NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD can be handled for both controllers and namespaces.  But a lot of these are obviously invalid if sent to controllers (hence you fail the IOCTL in those cases).  It would be cleaner to have two ioctl functions - one for controllers and one for namespaces.  It is OK for both ioctl functions to have a case statement for NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD (or any others that could be sent to both controller and namespace devices).",
