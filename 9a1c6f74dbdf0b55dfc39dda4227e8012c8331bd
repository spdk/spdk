      "message": "Do we need some kind of locking or coordination here?\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of the case where another core is reconnecting an io qpair and reading trid at the same point it\u0027s been updated here.  trid can\u0027t be changed atomically.  But I guess we can\u0027t change the trid unless the controller is failed, and if the controller is failed, we can\u0027t try to reconnect.  So I guess this is OK.\n\nIt might be good to spell some of that out here in a comment.",
