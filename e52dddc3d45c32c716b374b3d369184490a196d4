      "message": "I think this breaks the tsc tracking code that Vishal added.\n\nI\u0027m not sure exactly how we should handle this - maybe longer term the tsc stats stuff should be in the thread, not the reactor?  But for now, I think you need to do:\n\nrc \u003d spdk_thread_poll(thread, 0);\n\nrc is supposed to be 1, 0, or -1 to indicate if the spdk_thread_poll call did real work, didn\u0027t do any real work (i.e. no events and the poller didn\u0027t really do anything, for example the nvme completion queue had no completions), or unknown.",

      "message": "This part is actually much more complex. When setting up the reactors, there are events that we actually want to target at a specific core (not a thread). These events can fire both before and after threads exist at all. So I left in the old event mechanism as a way to handle these. We could probably make the event pool much smaller though.\n\nI think in a future patch, these events will be the mechanism by which threads are passed between reactors too.",
