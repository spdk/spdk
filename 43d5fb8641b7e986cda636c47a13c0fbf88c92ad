      "message": "Hi Ben/Daniel,\n\nFirst time, I have the same idea as you. However, you can see that each io qpair will have their own thread to destruct, so we can not directly delete the admin qpair here. If my understanding is correct, the admin qpair should make sure that all I/O qpairs are deleted, then we can delete the admin qpair in this case. \n\nIf you directly do the remove and call the nvmf_qpair_fini, the admin qpair will be deleted earlier than other I/O qpair from logic since you cannot guarantee the order, which sounds not a correct behavior from my understanding.\n\nAnd from the initiator side, it may see the admin qpair is destroyed earlier than I/O qpair.",

      "message": "Modifying the ctrlr data structure must be done only on the core that owns the admin qpair, so you can\u0027t send a message to an arbitrary qpair\u0027s thread and call ctrlr_delete_qpair on line 319.\n\nThe way this really needs to work is in spdk_nvmf_ctrlr_disconnect, it needs to check if the qpair disconnecting is the admin qpair. If it is, it should do an spdk_for_each_channel on the spdk_nvmf_tgt structure to send a message to each poll group. On each poll group, destroy every qpair associated with the given controller.
